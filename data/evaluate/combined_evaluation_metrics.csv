"Which method, HBPM or ABPM, was suggested to be superior in identifying patients with masked hypertension who have early LV remodeling and diastolic LV dysfunction?",The results suggest that home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) may be superior to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in identifying patients with masked hypertension who have early LV remodeling and diastolic LV dysfunction.,HBPM was suggested to be more effective than ABPM in identifying masked hypertension (MH) associated with impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation [Source: nihms-1766793.pdf].,5,4,Yes,5,164,11.628500011283904,2432.475300010992,2452.707399992505,5.043886395812912e-155,0.3793103448275862,0.1071428571428571,0.2758620689655172,0.2992198298653951,0.7295362949371338,0.7862321734428406,0.7568238973617554,49.182655334472656

Why is timely diagnosis of primary aldosteronism important for patient outcomes?,"Timely diagnosis allows for targeted medical and/or surgical management, which can help patients achieve blood pressure goals, reduce risk for cardiovascular events, reduce left ventricular mass, improve hypokalemia, improve kidney function, and reduce risk for all-cause mortality.","Timely diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is important for patient outcomes because it can avert cardiovascular risk and prevent avoidable target organ injury [Source: nihms-1824192.pdf].
