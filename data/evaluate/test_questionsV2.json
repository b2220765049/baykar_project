    "question": "Is screening for primary aldosteronism in the hypertensive obstructive sleep apnea population cost-saving?",
    "answer": "Yes, for patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, rigorous screening for primary aldosteronism is cost-saving due to the cardiovascular risk that is averted.",

  {
    "question": "What is the estimated prevalence of primary aldosteronism in patients with resistant hypertension?",
    "answer": "Primary aldosteronism is now recognized to represent 12% to 22% of resistant hypertension cases.",
    "query_length": "mid"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does primary aldosteronism carry a higher risk profile than essential hypertension?",
    "answer": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) bears a risk profile that is substantially higher than that of essential hypertension because hyperaldosteronism provokes vascular and cardiac fibrosis, and the resulting increased complication rates are independent of blood pressure levels.",

    "question": "What is minoxidil?",
    "answer": "Minoxidil, also known as Loniten, is a potent antihypertensive drug that works by dilating pre-capillary arterioles.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four physiologic mechanisms that contribute to edema from minoxidil?",
    "answer": "The four mechanisms are: 1. Capillary Leakage due to arteriolar dilation, 2. Reduced Glomerular Filtration Pressure due to blood pressure lowering, 3. Renal Nerve Released Norepinephrine causing sodium retention, and 4. Beta adrenoceptor mediated renin release leading to aldosterone production.",

    "question": "How did ACE inhibitors and ARBs compare in their effect on the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in hypertensive patients?",
    "answer": "The efficacy of ACE inhibitors on improving the glucose infusion rate (GIR) was significantly better than that of ARBs (WMD = -1.09, 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.85, P < 0.001).",

    "question": "In treated hypertensive individuals, what was the relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the risk of severe COVID-19?",
    "answer": "There was a J-shaped relationship; elevated SBP showed a dose-response relationship with severe COVID-19 (e.g., SBP 150-159mmHg had an OR of 1.91), and SBP <120mmHg was also associated with greater odds of severe COVID-19 (OR 1.40).",
