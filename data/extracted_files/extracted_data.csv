Abstract
Purpose of Review This review aims to inform the reader of the complexity of blood pressure responses when comparing
blood pressure measured in the medical environment to that outside the medical environment. In addition, we summarize
what is known about current predictors of white coat hypertension, reevaluate the relationship of white coat hypertension
to cardiovascular outcomes, and provide some clinical guidance on management.
Recent Findings Differences in outcomes exist when white coat effect occurs in unmedicated people versus the white coat
effects in those on antihypertensive therapy.
Summary White coat hypertension is relatively common, carries a small but definite increase in cardiovascular risk, and
is prone to conversion to sustained hypertension. Future research will hopefully tease out the roles of ancillary findings
that characterize a white coat hypertensive (like modest elevations in creatinine, glucose and triglycerides) in the elevated
cardiovascular risk, and test the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in these patients.

Prevalence and prognosis of left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction in community
hypertension patients

Abstract
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is common in hypertension and is a predictor of increased cardiovascular
risk, however the effect of LVDD, detected by new guideline, on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) is unknown in
hypertensive patients without known cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to evaluate LVDD in a commu-
nity hypertension cohort study and assess the effect of LVDD on MACE. we studied 283 asymptomatic nonischemic
patients with hypertension who had baseline echocardiogram between 2012 and 2014. Patients were followed for
MACE (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedures, heart failure, stroke, all-cause mortality) with
mean follow-up of 5.4 years. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association of LVDD with
MACE. At baseline, 35 of the 283 hypertensions were diagnosed with LVDD (12.3%) and 25 patients were women
(15.5%). Women had higher frequency of LVDD than men (8%). During follow-up, there were 26.6% patients occur-
ring MACE in the LVDD group at baseline, 9.9% patients occurring MACE in the group with normal diastolic function.
In multivariable Cox regression analyses, LVDD was a stronger predictor of MACE (HR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.20 to 5.25; c- sta-
tistics 0.805) than E/e′ ratio (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.22). LVDD was strongly associated with MACE in hypertension
patients.

and angiotensin-II -a case-control study

Abstract
Background Hypertension is a major cause of cardiac dysfunction. The earliest manifestation is left ventricular
remodeling/hypertrophy. The occurrence of adverse cardiac remodeling and outcomes occurs irrespective of age in
blacks. This necessitated an estimate of the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and an assessment of the
roles of the mammalian target organ of rapamycin (mTOR) and angiotensin-II (Ang II) as possible pathogenic markers
of LVH among young hypertensives.
Methods This prospective case-control study involved 110 hypertensive and 60 normotensive (control) participants
aged 18–45 across tertiary hospitals in Ekiti state. Ethical approval was obtained from all the various institutions.
Participants were recruited consecutively after giving informed consent. Sociodemographic/clinical information,
resting electrocardiogram and echocardiography were obtained. Venous blood was obtained to estimate mTOR, Ang
II, Chemerin, lipids – triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), troponin-T, NF-Kβ, and
Galectin-3 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results The prevalence of LVH among the hypertensive group was 20.9%, 39%, 11.01%, and 15.74% using
2D-transthoracic echocardiography, Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell’s and Cornell product ECG criteria. Also, hypertensives
with LVH had a significantly increased blood pressure, body mass index, serum level of TG, TG/HDL, TC/HDL, chemerin,
troponin T, Galectin-3 and total mTOR compared to normotensive and hypertensives without LVH. At the same time,
serum NF-kβ and Ang II were only significant when compared with normotensive but not hypertensives without LVH.
The total mTOR moderately correlated positively with ANG-II.
Conclusions The results suggest an interaction between mTOR and Ang II in the development of LVH. In addition, it
shows that LVH is associated with dyslipidemia, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Discussion
The heart is one of the organs affected by hypertension
[14]. Left ventricular remodeling is a common initial
adaptive mechanism of the heart to HTN [4, 15]. Left
ventricular remodeling can manifest as concentric or
eccentric hypertrophy. The development of LVH further
worsens cardiovascular outcomes irrespective of age [1,

Effect and mechanism of HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor on the improvement of elderly
essential hypertension-induced vascular
endothelial function impairment based on the
JAK/STAT pathway

Abstract
Objective Our research was designed to figure out the influence and mechanism of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor on the improvement of elderly essential hypertension-induced vascular
endothelial function impairment based on the JAK/STAT pathway.
Methods Eighty-six elderly patients with essential hypertension were randomized into a control group (oral
Amlodipine Besylate Tablets) and an observation group (oral Amlodipine Besylate Tablets + HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor atorvastatin calcium). Patients in both groups were treated with the drug for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, serum
levels of inflammatory factors, and vascular endothelial function indicators, and levels of blood lipids were measured.
The modeled rats were treated with atorvastatin calcium and a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor (AG490), and the levels
of cardiac function-related indices, left ventricular mass index, lipid levels, serum inflammatory factors and vascular
endothelial function-related indices were detected in each group.
Results HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor improved blood pressure levels, lipid levels, serum inflammatory factor levels
and cardiac function in elderly patients with essential hypertension. Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and AG490
improved blood pressure levels, lipid levels, serum inflammatory factor levels and cardiac function in SHR rats. Both
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and AG490 decreased p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3 expression levels.
Conclusion Our study demonstrates that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor improves elderly essential hypertension-
induced vascular endothelial function impairment by blocking the JAK/STAT pathway.

Previous studies reported the association of WCHT with the association between MHT and depression. Although the
depression,anxiety,mentalstress,andintrovertedpersonality Finn-Home study showed that MHT was associated with
traits[9,10,12,29].Nonetheless,fewstudieshaveevaluated depression,theanalysisfordepressiondidnotincludeenough

covariates[14].Anotherstudyincludingpatientswithtreated
HT reported that the risk of depression was approximately
7-fold higher in the MHT group than in the controlled HT
group[15].Thefindingsofourstudywereconsistentwiththe
results of these studies, except for in male participants with
treated HT. Of note, our study analyzed in details the asso-
ciationbetween MHTand depressivesymptomsusing a lar-
gersamplesizethandidthese previousstudies(6705inthis
study; 1459 and 328 in previous studies, respectively) and
includedparticipantswithandwithouttreatedHT.
One possible mechanism underlying the association
betweendepressivesymptomsandMHTmaybeautonomic
nervoussystemdysregulation.Considerableevidenceexists
regarding autonomic nervous system dysregulation in
patients with depression [30]. Catecholamine levels, which
reflect sympathetic activity, are higher in patients with
depression than in healthy controls [30]. The HR is regu-
lated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
systems. Additionally, autonomic nervous system dys-
function leads to a reduction in HR variability [31]. A
frequency-domain analysis of HR variability showed sym-
pathetic arousal and reduced parasympathetic activity in
individuals with depressive symptoms [32]. In our study,
the HRs in the research center and at home were higher in
the participants with depressive symptoms after adjusting
forageandsex,suggestinghypersympatheticactivity[30].
This might have increased the home BP and caused MHT.
With respect to the BP level categories, the sympathetic
nerve activity was greater in the participants with MHT,
sustainedHT,andWCHTthaninnormotensiveindividuals
[33]. Isolated nocturnal HT, which overlaps with MHT, is
related to excess sympathetic activation due to nocturnal
activity and sleep apnea [34–36]. Hyper sympathetic
activity is common in patients with depression and MHT.
Diurnal BP variability and BP response to stress may
partiallyexplainourresults.IncreaseddiurnalBPvariability
andless nocturnalBP dippinghave been reportedinpeople
withmentalillnesses,includingdepression[32,37,38],and
arecausedbyreducedbaroreflexsensitivity[39].Aprevious
study showed that the white-coat effect, defined as BP in
officeminusBPatrest,wasassociatedwithanenhancedBP
responsetomentalstress[10].Stresstriggersdepression[40],
andBPresponsestostressmaybeaffectedbydepression.
Another mechanism may be related to cortisol, an HT-
inducingadrenocorticalhormone[41–43].Apreviousstudy
showed that serum cortisol levels were significantly higher
in participants with depression; as depressive symptoms
became severe, cortisol levels increased [44]. Cortisol has
diurnal variation, and may thus cause diurnal BP variation
and MHT [43].
The interaction effect between sex and depressive
symptoms was observed, and depressive symptoms were
associated with MHT more strongly inmale than in female

OPEN Prevalence of and factors
associated with hypertension
according to JNC 7 and ACC/AHA
2017 guidelines in Bangladesh
Md. Ashfikur Rahman 1*, Henry Ratul Halder 2,3, Uday Narayan Yadav 4,5 &
Sabuj Kanti Mistry 5,6
Most studies either followed Joint National Committee 7 (JNC 7) or World Health Organization-
International Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) guidelines to ascertain the prevalence of
hypertension among Bangladeshi adults. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association (ACC/AHA) revised the definition of hypertension in 2017, which has significant public
health importance. In Bangladesh, the new guideline has resulted changes in prevalence and risk
factors for hypertension compared to the JNC7 guideline. This study used data from the most recent
round (2017–2018) of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). According to the 2017
ACC/AHA guideline, the participants were categorized as hypertensive if they had blood pressure
(BP) ≥ 130/80 mmHg, but it was ≥ 140/90 mmHg in JNC 7 guideline. A total of 11,959 participants were
involved in the analysis. The median (IQR) age of the respondents was 34.0 (18.0–95.0) years. The
prevalence of hypertension was 24.0% according to the JNC 7 guideline, which was 50.5% according
to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Participants who were overweight and obese, aged, member of
affluent households, Rangpur and Rajshahi division inhabitants had significantly higher odds of
being hypertensive according to both guidelines. The new guideline suggests that half of the adult
population in Bangladesh is hypertensive when measured according to the new guideline, urging
the policymakers and public health practitioners to take immediate action to address the already
established modifiable risk factors.
Key points
Question. What changes occurred in prevalence of and associated factors with hypertension among Bangla-
deshi adults (aged 18–95 years) due to 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC 7 guidelines?
Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered the leading causes of deaths or disability-adjusted life
years, where hypertension plays a pivotal role in CVDs1–3. In 2016, around 17.9 million people died from CVDs,
representing 31% of total global deaths, of which 9.4 million deaths were attributed to h ypertension4,5. Worldwide,
approximately 1.13 billion people have hypertension, and two-thirds of them live in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh4.
Due to the recent epidemiologic and demographic transitions, Bangladesh has documented significant life-
style and behavioral changes with an increased prevalence of hypertension. According to the 2011 Bangla-
desh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) and the 2010 Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Survey,
the prevalence of hypertension among the adult population was 25.7% and 17.9%, r espectively6,7. Henceforth,
hypertension remains the foremost disease burden among the major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in
Bangladesh, like other South Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka8.

The blood pressure (BP) threshold to classify prehypertension and hypertension varies according to different
guidelines. Previously, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) on Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure described hypertension as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90mmHg9. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management
of High Blood Pressure in Adults reduced the BP threshold for hypertension. According to the 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline, hypertensive individuals have a SBP of ≥ 130 mmHg and/or a DBP of ≥ 80 mmHg10. Therefore,
previously considered prehypertensive participants are reclassified as hypertensive due to changes in the cut-off
v alues6,11–13. For example, the prevalence of hypertension among the Nepalese adult population almost doubled
following the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines12.
Furthermore, Muntner et al. reported a 14.7% increase in hypertension among American adults over 19 years
of age according to new guideline14. Another study found 45.1% and 26.8% increase in the prevalence of hyper-
tension among adults (aged between 45 and 75) in the US and China15. Several studies recognized the impor-
tance of this revised classification for public health resource planning and prevention strategies14–16. Despite
the increased burden of CVDs in developing countries, there remains inadequate information around the new
guideline of hypertension17–19.
Previous studies in Bangladesh reported a significant increase in hypertension when the 2017 ACC/AHA
guideline is being implemented to identify hypertensive individuals. Kibria et al. found that the prevalence of
hypertension among Bangladeshi adults aged ≥ 35 years increased from 25.7 to 48.0%6. Islam et al. reported the
findings from 1843 Bangladeshi adults aged over 18 years and found a similar increase (22.8%) in hypertension20.
Besides, Kibria et al. concluded that the risk factors and their level vary between the JNC 7 and ACC/AHA
g uidelines11. Thus, changes in prevalence and risk factors have direct and indirect implications and hold signifi-
cant merit in revising public health policies and plans to address the i ssue21. However, all these studies reported
the findings from the 2011 BDHS survey data. A recent research article compared the prevalence and risk factors
of hypertension between BDHS 2011 and BDHS 2017–2018 data using multiple logistic regression model22. The
prevalence ratio (PR) is a suitable method for cross-sectional study when the prevalence of a disease is > 10%23,24.
Hence, the statistical modeling in this study overestimated the estimated odds ratios for the risk factors. However,
we applied appropriate statistical methods to estimate the PR, which is a uniqueness of this study.
The present research was carried out to identify the change in the prevalence and associated factors of hyper-
tension according to the ACC/AHA guidelines in comparison to that of the JNC 7 guideline using the most
recent Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017–2018 data. This new dataset encompasses a
comparatively larger measurement of BP with more participants than 2011 BDHS. Therefore, the findings using
this latest dataset can broaden policy implications regarding hypertension management in Bangladesh.
Methods
Data sources. The study analyzed the most recent 2017–2018 BDHS dataset. The survey was carried out
from October 2017 to March 2018 under the National Institute of Population Research and Training, Medical
Education and Family Welfare Division, and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The survey’s principal
objective was to assess the health indicators and provide an overview of population, maternal and child health,
and the status of several NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes.
Study population and survey design. The sampling frame used for the 2017–2018 BDHS is the com-
plete list of enumeration areas (EAs) covering the entire population of Bangladesh. The survey used a list of
enumeration areas (EAs) provided by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics from the 2011 Population and Hous-
ing Census of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The survey’s primary sampling unit (PSU) is an EA covering
on average 120 households in 2017–2018. The 2017–2018 BDHS was a multistage stratified cluster sample of
households’ survey, carried out in two and three stages in rural and urban settings. In the first sampling stage,
rural wards were selected, following PSUs, and then households were selected from PSUs. In urban areas, wards
were selected through the PSUs technique, and one EA was selected from each PSU. Then, the households were
chosen from the selected EAs sample. A detailed description of the survey design, methodologies, sample size,
questionnaires, and findings is available in the final summary report of 2017–2018 BDHS. Anthropometry and
BP were also systematically measured from the selected subsample of 2017–2018 B DHS25. A total of 12,152
unweighted sample was found in the original dataset, which increased to 12,975 after applying the weight to
the dataset. However, we had to exclude 1016 cases due to missing values in some of the variables, making the
total weighted number of observations 11,959 for our analysis.
Dependent variable. The dependent variable for this study was hypertension. Trained health technicians
measured BP three times using LIFE SOURCE® UA-767 Plus BP monitor at about ten minutes interval25. Then,
the average of second and third measurements was used to report respondents’ final B P25. A person with a SBP
of ≥ 140 mmHg and/or a DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg was considered hypertensive, as suggested by the JNC 7 26. While
according to the ACC/AHA 2017 guideline, individuals with a SBP of ≥ 130 mmHg and/or a DBP of ≥ 80 mmHg
or who were taking any prescribed antihypertensive drugs to control BP were categorized as hypertensive27. The
category of prehypertension was transformed into elevated blood pressure in the 2017 ACC/AHA g uideline27.
Explanatory variables. The explanatory variables included in the study were selected based on previous
literature reporting the risk of hypertension in LMICs setting6,11,12,28–31. The household factors included admin-
istrative divisions (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sylhet, Mymensingh); place of resi-
dence (urban, rural); and wealth status (poorest, poorer, middle, richer, richest), whereas the socioeconomic

and individual factors included: age of the participants in years (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, ≥ 65); sex
of the participants (male, female); education level (no education, primary, secondary, higher); and occupational
status (not working, working). Behavioral characteristics included smoking habit (no, yes) and body mass index
(BMI) level. We have used global cut-off points for BMI classification: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal
(18.5–25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.1–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥ 30.0 kg/m2)32.
Statistical analysis. Considering the complex survey of BDHS, we prepared the data using the survey
weights before the analysis. Next, the normality assumption of continuous variables was investigated from their
distribution, and it was reported in the paper with medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Then, we estimated
the prevalence of hypertension and reported the differences between the two guidelines. We reported the preva-
lence of hypertension by background characteristics accounting for complex survey design/survey weight. It is
notable to mention that survey weights only account for the sampling scheme. Therefore, we standardized the
prevalence of hypertension for the same standard population to remove or minimize the impact of differences in
participant’s age and sex distribution. On the next step, we fitted the selected explanatory variables in unadjusted
log-binomial regression model. Thereafter, we executed a log-binomial regression model considering survey
weights including the explanatory variables having p-values (< 0.05) in the unadjusted analysis to identify the
factors associated with hypertension, describing results with prevalence ratios (PRs) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) and p-values. We used Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26 and S AS® OnDe-
mand for Academics for data analysis.
Ethical consideration. The study used secondary data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
Program publicly available; therefore, we did not require any further ethical approval. The details of ethical pro-
cedures followed by the DHS Program can be found in the BDHS report25.
Results
A total of 11,959 weighted participants were included in the analysis (Table 1). The median (IQR) age of the
respondents was 34.0 years (18.0–95.0). Of the total participants, 6835 (57.2%) were female (Table 1). The median
(IQR) of SBP and DBP were 118 mmHg (109–131) and 80 mmHg (73–87), respectively. Most of the participants
(75.8%) have their BP measured at least once. The median BMI was 21.91 kg/m2 (19.4–24.9). In addition, 25.4%
had no education, and 73.4% were residing in rural areas.
Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of hypertension among the participants according to JNC 7 and ACC/
AHA guideline, along with the differences between these two guidelines. Prevalence of hypertension in urban
areas was 25.1% (95% CI 22.4–25.6%) in the JNC 7 and 54.0% (95% CI 52.5–55.5%) in the ACC/AHA guideline,
making the difference of more than twice between them. As per JNC 7, the prevalence of hypertension among
women was 24.6% (95% CI 23.1–25.6%), and it was 24.3% (95% CI 23.1–25.4%) among men, which increased
considerably when the new guideline was applied. A similar result was also observed for other explanatory
variables (i.e., administrative divisions, age of the participants, BMI level, education level, occupational status,
wealth status, and smoking habit).
Table 3 describes the risk factors associated with hypertension under JNC 7 and ACC/AHA guidelines after
adjusting the explanatory variables in the log-binomial multivariate model setting. Advanced age, increased
BMI, and participants from Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions had higher PRs as per both guidelines, indicating an
increased risk of hypertension. Alternatively, smoking had a significantly lower impact on hypertension only in
JNC 7, but the result is insignificant for ACC/AHA guideline. To note, before fitting explanatory variables in the
log-binomial multivariate setting, we checked unadjusted log-binomial models and found that participants’ age,
place of residence, and occupational status had an insignificant impact on hypertension in one of the guidelines
(Supplementary Table 1). Thus, we did not include these variables while multivariate modeling.
Figure 1 exerts the results of single-adjusted models where people age (≥ 65) showed the strongest associa-
tion with developing hypertension (UPR = 6.58, 95% CI 5.66–7.65, p < 0.001) followed by age (55–64; 45–54 and
35–44) showed greater odds of having hypertensive according to JNC 7 guidelines. Whereas the magnitude of
associations as per 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines shows the highest odds age (≥ 65), followed by age bracket (55–64
and 45–54), obese people have had the highest odds of having hypertensive (UPR = 2.26, 95% CI 2.10–2.43,
p < 0.001).
Discussion
The current study presented unique findings based on recently published BDHS data released by the government
of Bangladesh in 2020 under DHS program. A few studies examined the prevalence of hypertension according
to the new guideline and have compared the results with previous JNC 7 g uidelines6,12. These studies found an
absolute change in hypertension prevalence after applying the new 2017 ACC/AHA guidance. The benefit of
early detection of hypertensive individuals would reduce hypertension-related complications and cardiovascular
morbidity.
Our findings depicted the change in the estimated prevalence of hypertension in Bangladesh as per JNC
7 and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, developed to classify prehypertension and hypertension status in humans.
Under these two guidelines, we found differences in the prevalence rate at the national and individual lev-
els. In the year 2011, according to the new lower blood pressure threshold recommended by 2017 ACC/AHA
guidelines, (43.3%) prevalence of hypertension observed in Bangladesh was higher at the national level, while
(20.9%) lower prevalence was documented in the previous recommendation of JNC 76,33,34. Our study showed,
the prevalence of hypertension augmented alarmingly in both conditions; 24.0% according to JNC 7 and 50.5%
in 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. The prevalence of hypertension according to JNC 7 was 20.9% in 2 0116,33,34, and

increase in the prevalence of hypertension, which requires the need of urgent attention from all the stakeholders
who are interested in prevention and control of hypertension in Bangladesh.
Interestingly, our findings reported a similar prevalence of hypertension among male and female participants.
If we compare the finding based on the previous study, the prevalence rate increased among female participants
more than male counterparts11,28. The plausible explanation could be biological and behavioural characteristics
among the females might have increased over the period. This fact is supported by the previous evidence that
females have a higher risk of obesity and diabetes compared with men36,37. This needs females to require more
awareness and public health information to control hypertension and minimize adverse complications28. Our
study findings reported that people with higher socioeconomic status had higher odds of having hypertension.
The higher wealth status participants can generally purchase more consumable resources with a large amount
of calorie intake, making them overweight or obese, putting them at a greater risk of being hypertensive than
those lower wealth status38,39. This suggests the need for prevention and control program for hypertension in
urban areas of Bangladesh.
The prevalence of hypertension was higher among those living in urban areas, which is in line with previous
studies where urban people were reported more hypertensive6,28,40,41. The possible reason could be prevail-
ing unhealthy lifestyle factors such as less physical activity, consumption of unhealthy diets among the urban
populations might have contributed to the disease burden42–44. However, this finding warrants further detailed

investigation of causes for the increased prevalence or odds of hypertension in several Bangladesh divisions28.
This finding suggests the need to understand the social inequalities among the rural and urban community, which
may have played a role in such variation. Understanding the inequalities mentioned earlier may help design the
comprehensive hypertension prevention and control program for Bangladesh peoples.
There is another explanation that would help understand why the prevalence of hypertension is high in urban
areas. The study found that higher educated and higher wealth status of people are likely lives in urban areas,
resulting from having a sedentary lifestyle such as low physical activity. A lack of open spaces for playing games
or physical activity might result in the high-risk prevalence of hypertension28. Since most urban participants
are educated, and these had a higher prevalence of hypertension. Thus our study recommends that educated
individuals in urban areas need to receive more public health awareness information to control raised blood
pressure l evels28.
This study identified the potential risk factors of hypertension using both JNC 7 and 2017 ACC/AHA guide-
line alongside to the estimation of the prevalence. People of older age 25 to more, overweight, and obese had
relatively higher odds, which is in line with previous studies elsewhere6,12,45–47. Notably, in the current study,
administrative divisions were also found significantly associated with hypertension in line with suggest 2017
ACC/AHA guidelines. People from Rangpur and Rajshahi division found higher odds in the two guidelines.
Much is unknown why the people from these two divisions owned higher risk of being hypertensive; however,
the reason may be because of socioeconomic inequalities such as limited resources, income inequality, low level
of education and social safety net programs, poor connectivity with the urban centres, insufficiency or absence
of public infrastructure48,49.
The new 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating stage 1 hypertension with changing lifestyle meas-
ures and taking antihypertensive medicines to prevent future cardiovascular disease r isks12. Our study findings
are significant because it shows that above fifty per cent of adults with hypertension or elevated blood pressure
according to the new 2017 ACC/AHA classification require active lifestyles and healthy dietary habits. Public
health programs should adequately address this emerging problem; in Bangladesh, emphasis should be paid to
prevention and self-management of a condition not only for those with hypertension but also for all adults12.
Therefore, it is essential to estimate the prevalence based on both thresholds to control this hypertension burden,
which might exacerbate cardiovascular disease. These findings might help future researchers and appropriate
authority design any programs and policies regarding control and prevent hypertension burden and overcome
this massive public health challenge.
The strengths and weaknesses of this study are accredited. The strength that lies in this study is the gener-
alizability of the findings for Bangladesh since this survey covered nationally representative data covering all
divisions. Along with appropriate statistical methods to estimate the weighted prevalence of hypertension from
the sample.
The limitations of the study are appropriately acknowledged. Due to a cross-sectional setup, no causality
cannot be established, and the individuals’ blood pressure was measured three times in a single day. However,

both guidelines recommend longitudinal measurement of blood pressure levels to diagnose hypertension12.
This survey also used an automated device, though both guidelines recommend recording blood pressure with
a s phygmomanometer33,50,51.
Conclusions
The present study highlighted that the prevalence of hypertension was almost doubled according to the 2017
ACC/AHA guideline compared to the JNC 7 guideline. The policymakers and public health practitioners should
consider the new guideline and make new strategies to increase awareness among the adult population in Bang-
ladesh. The study finding also points towards addressing the already established modifiable risk factors of hyper-
tension such as overweight/obesity, high-income status, which are also identified as the risk factors according
to both guidelines.

Therenin–angiotensin–aldosteronesystem(RAAS)isoffundamentalimportancein

RAASinhibitionhastherapeuticimplicationsforseveralchronicdiseases,suchasSAH,
type2diabetesandheartfailure[12].

ofRAAS[14].
Angiotensinogen is a circulating protein, synthesized by the liver, which will be
metabolizedundertheactionofrenin,formingangiotensinI,apeptide. Theconversion
ofangiotensinI(Ang-I)toangiotensinII(Ang-II)occursmainlythroughtheactionofthe
angiotensin-convertingenzyme(ACE)inthepulmonarymicrocirculation[15].
AngiotensinIIactsbystimulatingthetype1angiotensinII(AT1R)receptor,causing
vasoconstrictioninthecardiovascularsystem,reducingtheexcretionofsodiumandwater,
stimulatingthesynthesisofaldosterone,amineralocorticoidsynthesizedintheglomeru-
losa of the adrenal cortex, among other functions [12,16]. Aldosterone also modulates

ManymiRNAsregulateRAASgenes. MiR-27bandmiR-145attenuateangiotensin

MiR-483targetsmultipleRAASgenes,suchasangiotensinogen(AGT),ACE-1,ACE-2
andangiotensinogenreceptor2(AGTR2),however,theexpressionofmiR-483isdownreg-
ulatedinvascularsmoothmusclecells(VSMCs)stimulatedwithAng-II,whichleadsto

MicrovascularrarefactionisaprocessthatoccursinindividualswithSAHthatde-

the expression of several miRNAs that regulate vascular remodeling in SAH, being an

Clinical studies also show changes in the expression of miRNAs in hypertensive
patients. MiR-136 is downregulated in the serum of patients with hypertension and is
associated with elevated levels of RAAS biochemical markers [34]. However, miR-202
isoverexpressedinthebloodofhypertensivepatients,byreducingthereceptorsoluble
(sST2),beingassociatedwithhighlevelsofAng-IIandvascularinflammation[35].

3. MiRNAsandSympatheticNervousSystemActivationinSAH
Thesympatheticnervoussystem(SNS)playsafundamentalroleinbloodpressure
controlthroughregulatorymechanismsexpressedbasedonthereleaseofneurotransmitters
(epinephrine,norepinephrineanddopamine)thatactonvessels,kidneysandheart. Thus,
changesinthefunctionsofthissystemarerelatedtothedevelopmentofcardiovascular
disorders[66].
Cardiacoutputandsystemicvascularresistancearethemaintargetcomponentsfor
theactionofsympatheticneurotransmittersthroughtheirrelease,bycentralandreflex
mechanisms,andbindingtotheiradrenergic(αandβ)anddopaminergicreceptors. These
mechanisms,whenactivated,promoteanarteriolarvasoconstriction(throughα-receptors)
andanincreaseincardiacoutput(throughβ-receptors)resultinginanelevationofblood
pressure[67,68].
ActivationoftheSNSoccursinstatesofphysicaloremotionalstress. However,in
early stages of SAH, known as a hyperkinetic circulatory state, there is an increase in
adrenergicimpulseandadecreaseinparasympatheticfunction[67],thatis,thereisan
increaseinplasmalevelsofsympatheticneurotransmittersconcomitantwithalossofvagal
inhibitoryfunction. Furthermore,themagnitudeofsympatheticactivationparallelsthe
severityofbloodpressureelevation[68].
MiRNAs also participate in the regulation of the SNS. Specifically, miR-181a was
downregulatedinageneticmodelofmassiveSNSactivation,leadingtoincreasedrenin
expression,RAASactivation,andconsequentlyhypertensioninmice[49]. Overexpres-
sion of miR-135a and miR-376 were also associated with increased sympathetic nerve

Inthiscontext,miR-22isalsohighlyexpressedinspontaneouslyhypertensiverats,

Furthermore,othermiRNAscanbedysregulatedduetoactivationofthesympathetic

4. MiRNAsandLeftVentricularHypertrophyinSAH
Underphysiologicalconditions,strokevolumeisregulatedbypreloadthroughmech-
anismsthatinvolvetheextensionofcardiacfibersattheendofdiastoleassociatedwith
resistance imposed by afterload [70]. Mechanical stress on the heart induces changes
involvingstrain(relatedtoincreasedafterload)andshearstress(relatedtobloodfriction
againstthevesselwall)resultingincompensatoryadaptiveeffectswhenchronicallyaltered
inordertokeepthecardiacoutput[71].
Thismechanicalstressisoneofthetriggeringfactorsofcardiacremodeling,which
occursthroughprocessesofcardiomyocytehypertrophy,hyperplasia,hypertrophyofnon-
musclecellsandinterstitialproliferation[72]. Cardiaccellremodelingandhypertrophy,
inresponsetomechanicalstressinSAH,arethemechanismsthatleadtoleftventricular

cardiacchamber. Hyperplasiaofvascularstructuresandcollagenaccumulationalsooccur,
favoringcardiacfibrosis[74].
Several miRNAs participate in the LVH process. In human-induced pluripotent
stem-cell-derivedcardiomyocytesstimulatedwithendothelin-1(ET-1),miR-19a,miR-21,
miR-29bandmiR-199areoverexpressed,generatingcardiachypertrophyinvitro,however,
whentheanalysiswasperformedoncirculatingmiRNAsintheserumofchagasicpatients
withLVH,onlymiR-19a,miR-21andmiR-29bwereoverexpressed[43]. Incardiomyocytes
derived from neonatal rats stimulated with ET-1, miR-19a and miR-19b promoted hy-
pertrophyofthesecardiomyocytes,reducingtheexpressionofanti-hypertrophictarget
genes atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MURF-1), and it also activated the
pro-hypertrophicpathwaycalcineurin/nuclearfactorofactivatedT-cells(NFAT)[41].
Ontheotherhand,Ang-II-inducedpressureoverloadinratsreducedtheexpression
of miR-19a and miR-19b, increasing the expression of phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A),
generatingLVH,including,astheauthorsshowinthesamestudy,thatamodeloftrans-

Likewise,inbothinvitroandinvivomodelsstimulatedwithAng-II,theexpressionof
miR-410andmiR-495isincreased,modulatingtheexpressionofthehypertrophicgenes
NppaandNppb,promotingarobusthypertrophyofcardiomyocytes[48].
Inanmodelofhypertensivemiceoverexpressingrenin,itpromotedSAHbyincreasing
theexpressionofmiR-208aand208b,decreasingtheexpressionofthetranscriptionfactor
SOX-6,whichisarepressorofalpha-myosinheavychain(MyHC),increasingtheexpression
ofthelattergene,inducingLVH[47].
MiR-208b was also overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pa-
tientswithSAH,inaddition, othermiRNAswerealsooverexpressedinthesesamples,
such as miR-1, miR-21 and miR-499, while miR-26b and miR-133a were with reduced
expression and this expression pattern correlated with LVH in these patients [58]. In
studies in humans, animals and cells, the reduction of miR-133a expression promotes
LVHorcardiomyocyteshypertrophyandtheoverexpressionofthismiRNAinducesan
anti-hypertrophiceffect[75,76].
ThemiR-29family(miR-29a,miR-29bandmiR-29c),inturn,isoverexpressedinthe
plasmaofpatientswithSAH,regulatinggenesofthefibroticandhypertrophicprocess,
havingastrongcorrelationwithhighbloodpressureandLVH[61].Inagreementwiththese
results,miR-29awasalsoshownwithincreasedexpressionintheplasmaofhypertensive

Ontheotherhand,miR-29bhaditsexpressionreducedinamousemodelofAng-

inflammatoryandfibroticprofile,inadditiontoattenuatingtheheartdamageandLVHin
theseanimals[54]. ThisfindingdemonstratesthattheexpressionpatternofmiRNAsmay
bedifferentinhypertensivepatientscomparedtoanimalmodels.
Another miRNA that is associated with the process of inflammation and cardiac
hypertrophyismiR-155. InbothinvivoandinvitromodelsofAng-II-inducedcardiac
hypertrophy,miR-155isoverexpressed,reducingtheexpressionoftheinhibitorofnuclear
factorkappa-Bkinasesubunitepsilon(IKBKE),promotingactivationofthenuclearfactor
kappa- B (NF-κB), inflammation and cardiac hypertrophy [42]. In this same work, it
wasshownthattheoverexpressionofthelongnon-codingRNAknownascytoskeleton

thismiRNA,andconsecutivelyincreasingtheexpressionofIKBKE,inhibitingtheNF-κB
pathway,reducinginflammationandcardiomyocytehypertrophy[42].
MiR-155alsohadincreasedexpressionintheplasmaofhypertensivepatients,and
thishighexpressionwasassociatedwithinflammatorymarkerssuchasinterleukin-6(IL-6)

Althoughnumerousclinicalandexperimentalstudieshaveclearlyidentifiedasexualdimor-
phism in blood pressure control, the mechanism(s) underlying gender differences in blood
pressure remain unclear. Over the past two decades, numerous laboratories have utilized
thespontaneouslyhypertensiverats(SHR)asanexperimentalmodelofessentialhyperten-
sion to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating blood pressure in males
and females. Previous work by our group and others have implicated that differential reg-
ulationofadrenergicreceptors,therenin–angiotensinsystem,oxidativestress,nitricoxide
bioavailability and immune cells contribute to sex differences in blood pressure control in
SHR. The purpose of this review is to summarize previous findings to date regarding the
mechanismsofbloodpressurecontrolinmaleversusfemaleSHR.

Sex and gender differences in hypertension

Numerousstudieshaveexaminedthemechanismsunderlyingtestosterone-inducedincreasesinBPinmaleSHR.
In particular, the kidney has been implicated in sex differences in BP in SHR [33,44,45]. There is a hypertensive
shift in the pressure-natriuresis relationship in male SHR versus females and testosterone-induced reductions in

Mechanisms mediating sex differences in BP in SHR
Differential regulation of the adrenergic receptor
Theroleofadrenergicreceptoractivationintheregulationofvasculartoneiswellstudied,especiallyatthelevelof
smallresistancevascularbeds[49].Hypertensionisoftenassociatedwithalteredadrenergicresponsesinthevas-
culatureastheprevalenceandinteractionofα-adrenergic(mainlyconstrictor)andβ-adrenergicreceptors(mainly

β-adrenergicstimulationinSHR[57].Chronicstimulationofβ-adrenergicreceptorwithisoproterenolincreased
left ventricular-end diastolic (LVED) diameter in sham-operated, but not in castrated male SHR [57]. In females,
isoproterenolslightlyincreasedLVEDdiameter;however,ovariectomydidnotsignificantlychangeLVEDdiameter
suggestingthattestosteronecouldbethedrivingfactorforβ-adrenergic-inducedleftventricularremodeling[57].
Takentogether,differentialregulationofα-andβ-adrenergicreceptorsinSHRmaycontributetosexdifferencesin
BPcontrolinSHR.
Renin–angiotensin system
Therenin–angiotensinsystem(RAS)isamulti-enzymatichormonalsystemthatcontrolselectrolytebalance,body
fluid volume and BP [20,58]. The ‘classical’ RAS pathway involves the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to an-
giotensinII(AngII)byangiotensinconvertingenzyme(ACE).AngIIinteractionwithangiotensinIItype1(AT )
1
receptorsresultsinvasoconstriction,aldosteroneandvasopressinrelease,saltandwaterretention,sympatheticac-
tivation, increased oxidative stress, sodium reabsorption, cell proliferation and vascular hypertrophy [20,58]. The
non-classical RAS consists of ACE2, angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), the angiotensin II type 2 (AT ) receptor, and
2
the MAS receptor that oppose AT -mediated effects causing vasodilation, increases in blood flow and enhanced
1
pressure-natriuresis[20,58].

inBPcontrol.Inparticular,weassessedpro-inflammatoryCD3+CD4+Th17cellswhicharelinkedwithincreasesin
BPandanti-inflammatoryCD3+CD4+ Tregulatorycells(Tregs)whichlimitincreasesinBP[111,112].Consistent
withsexdifferencesinBP,wefoundthatmaleSHRhavemorerenalTh17cellsandfemaleSHRhavemoreTregs
[111,113,114].
TobegintogainmechanisticinsightintosexdifferencesinrenalTcellsinSHR,wefirstexaminedtherolesofsex
hormonesandBP[113].SexhormonescoulddrivesexdifferenceintheTcellprofileaspreviousfindingssuggestthat
bothestrogenandtestosteroneimpactTcellsinvitroandinvivo[115,116].EstrogenstimulatesTregproductionin

thesedata,gonadectomyincreasedTh17cellsanddecreasedTregsinbothsexes,althoughthesexdifferencesintheT
cellsweremaintained[113].Thesedatasuggestthatalthoughsexhormonesareanti-inflammatory,hormonesalone
cannotaccountforthesexdifferenceintheTcellprofile.
ToassesstheroleofhypertensionperseinmediatingsexdifferencesintherenalTcellprofile,maleandfemale
SHRweretreatedwithBPloweringdrugstoabolishboththehypertensionandthesexdifferencesinBP.Interestingly,
bothpreventingthedevelopmentofhypertensionandreversingestablishedhypertensionwereassociatedwithade-
creaseinrenalTregsinfemalestothelevelsobservedinmales[113],supportingthehypothesisthatfemalesexhibit
acompensatoryincreaseinTregsinresponsetoincreasesinBP.Indeed,thisconclusionissupportedbythefinding
thattherewerenosexdifferencesinrenalTregsin5-week-oldSHRpriortothedevelopmentofhypertension[120].
Although renal Th17 cells were not significantly altered by BP lowering drugs in SHR, there was a trend for
Th17cellstodecreaseinmaleswithdecreasesinBP[113].Toexaminethemechanismdrivingthiseffect,wemea-
sured necrosis in male and female SHR. Hypertensive stimuli induce cell death [121–123], and cellular necrosis
is pro-inflammatory. We found that male SHR had greater levels of renal necrosis versus females [114]. Blocking
necrosis with Necrox-5 decreased renal necrosis abolishing the sex difference and attenuated maturation-induced
increasesinBPinmaleSHR;BPinfemaleSHRwasnotalteredbyNecrox-5treatment[114].WhileNecrox-5de-
creased pro-inflammatory renal T cells in both sexes, sex differences were maintained [114]. Therefore, although
greaternecroticcelldeathinmaleSHRexacerbatesmaturation-inducedincreasesinBPwithagecontributingtosex
differencesinBP,necrosisisunlikelytoexplainsexdifferencesintherenalT-cellprofile.
BasedontheabilityofTregstoprotectagainstincreasesinBP,morestudieshavefocusedongainingadditional
insightintothemechanismsmodulatingTregsinfemaleSHR.Thelocalcytokineenvironmentisacriticaldetermi-

presenceoflowlevelsoftransforminggrowthfactor-β(TGF-β)andhighlevelsofinterleukin(IL)-6andIL-23.In
contrast,highconcentrationsofTGF-βwithlowIL-6levelsdrivesTregformation[98,116].Importantly,femaleSHR
havegreaterTGF-βexpressioncomparedwithmaleSHR[88,96,98,116].Inaddition,increasesinTregsfrom5to
13weeksofageinfemaleSHRareparalleledbyincreasesinTGF-β,ovariectomydecreasesrenalTregsandTGF-β,
andthedecreasesinTregswithBPloweringdrugsareaccompaniedbyadecreaseinTGF-βinfemaleSHR[115].
However,despiteTGF-βneutralizationdecreasingcirculatingTregs,renalTregswereunaffectedandBPwasnotal-

AdditionalstudiesinmaleandfemaleSHRusingtheNOSinhibitorL-NAMEfoundthatthecompensatoryincrease
in renal Tregs in female SHR is blocked in L-NAME hypertension [83], implicating an intact NOS system in the
abilityoffemaleSHRtoincreaseTregs.WefurthertestedthishypothesisinfemaleSprague-Dawleyratstreatedwith

Abstract
Background: Hypertension is an established risk factor for dementia, and the prevalence of hypertension and
dementia is rising. Current tests to diagnose cognitive dysfunction at an early stage lack sensitivity and
specificity. Recently event-related potentials (ERPs) have gained much attention in diagnosing cognitive
dysfunction and are independent of the education status of the subject. This study was done to find any
cognitive deficits in the hypertensive population with electrophysiological evidence, which might open the
doors for the need to screen the population at an earlier stage so that the population can be prevented from
dementia.
Methods: Some 31 middle-aged (18-65 years) hypertensives were compared with 31 age, sex, education, and
handedness matched normotensives about cognition by neuropsychometric test battery including Hindi
Mini-mental Status Examination (HMSE), Hindi Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), choice reaction
time (CRT), and auditory event-related potentials.
Results: Hypertensives and normotensives differed significantly concerning P300 potentials’ latency (Fz and
Cz P300 latencies: p-value: 0.001), and this change was correlated well with the duration of diastolic blood
pressure (BP) (r-value: 0.670). The remaining tests, HMSE, Hindi MoCA, and CRT, were dependent on the
education status of the patient.
Conclusions: The effect of hypertension on cognitive impairment is evident and can be proved early in its
pre-clinical stage using ERPs. Early identification can help in specifying high-risk individuals. ERPs have
great potential in screening and diagnosing and can also help in assessing cognition as a reliable tool to
show the effect of treatments/interventions on cognitive defects.

Introduction
Hypertension is an established risk factor for cognitive decline, and anti-hypertensives’ role in preventing
the same further substantiates it [1-3]. In 2000, the world was estimated to have nearly one billion people
with hypertension, increasing to 1.56 billion by 2025 [4].
The findings of cross-sectional studies of blood pressure (BP) and cognitive function have significantly
varied in their results, with some studies having higher rates of cognitive impairment associated with
elevated BP, others with low BP, and also U-shaped and J-shaped relationships [5-7]. However, longitudinal
studies showed a positive correlation between hypertension and cognitive decline. Randomized studies
showed a varied picture regarding the effects of treatment of hypertension on cognition [2]. Not only
cognitive function but also hypertension is also shown to increase oxidative stress levels and decrease heart
rate variability predisposing a person to an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality [8]. The quality
of life and sleep were also found to be poor among hypertensive patients [8-9].
After age 65, there is an exponential increase in lacunae and white matter changes [10], which might hinder
the detection of early cognitive deficits due to hypertension at a stage when early intervention can prevent
further deterioration, as the process of cognitive decline is irreversible. The controversy about the
association between later life hypertension and cognitive decline arises because the longitudinal
relationship between cognitive change and BP is sensitive to the effects of age, duration of follow-up and
number of BP measurements, hypertensive treatment status, comorbidity with cardiovascular diseases and
stroke, and possibly subclinical dementia [3].
Recently cognitive functions were able to assess objectively by event-related potentials (ERPs) and have
become an essential tool in evaluating dementia and related diseases. The advantage of these tests is that

they are independent of the patient’s education level and region. Significant functional impairment can be
localized as these are recorded in different areas of the scalp [11]. Among traditional ERP components, the
P300 has been most frequently explored. Occurring between 250 and 600 msec following stimulus
presentation, the P300 is presumed to reflect processes related to working memory and contextual
updating [12].
Vascular cognitive impairment caused by hypertension often involves executive functioning in the early
stages, which cannot be well picturized in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). In comparison,
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has a better chance of finding the same [5]. Hence a battery of tests,
including MMSE (Hindi version - HMSE), MoCA (Hindi MoCA), choice reaction time (CRT), and auditory
brain ERPs, were used in our study for better assessment of cognitive impairment at an early stage.
The study was carried out to look for electrophysiological evidence of cognitive deficits among the
hypertensive population at an early stage. This study will enlighten the need to screen the hypertensive
population for the cognitive deficit to prevent full-blown dementia.
Materials And Methods
The cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Thirty-one hypertensives and
31 normotensive subjects with matched age, sex, handedness, and education were taken in the
study. Patients attending out-patient department (OPD) diagnosed with hypertension [13], whose age,
gender, handedness, and education matched with the normal population were included in the
study. Excluded patients were those aged <18 years and >65 years, diagnosed with cognitive impairment and
psychiatric illness, central nervous system illness, and chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus, chronic
kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and connective tissue
disorders. Patients with psychiatric illness or taking psychotropic drugs, alcoholics (according to ICD 10
criteria), consumption of alcohol and caffeine within 24 h of the experimental session, and patients with
hearing difficulty who report hearing difficulty on questioning “do you feel you have a hearing loss?”[14],
were excluded from the study.
Patient evaluation
After taking informed consent, a detailed history was taken, and a physical examination was performed and
recorded in a pre-developed proforma (Appendix 1). BP was measured in all subjects according to American
Heart Association (AHA) guidelines [13]. The flow chart for the study is given in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1: Study flow chart.
The battery of tests for neuro-psychometric assessment [ERP-P300, Hindi Mini-Mental Status Examination
(HMSE), Hindi MoCA, and choice reaction time (CRT)] were applied in that order for uniformity.
Auditory P300
Guidelines were practised as guided by Picton et al. [15]. Subjects were informed about the procedure the day
before the scheduled ERP test on a phone call and advised for a head bath on the day of testing and to
abstain from caffeine and alcohol for 24 h before the test. After explaining the procedure in the laboratory,
he/she was seated comfortably, the procedure was explained, and written/informed consent for doing the
electrophysiological study was taken from each subject. The skin over the electrode site was cleaned with
Nuprep® (Weaver and Company, Aurora, CO) gel and electrodes were attached using Konix® (Turkauz Kong,
Instanbul, Turkey) paste. Pure silver disk electrodes (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) were used. The electrodes
were attached according to the standard protocol, and the test was run after giving the necessary
instructions to the patient. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes open as closing eyes can lead to alpha
waves in EEG, which can contaminate the response waveform. Odd-ball paradigm was applied in the test,
where two types of auditory stimuli (two different frequencies - target and non-target) were given to the
subject, and he/she needed to ignore the frequent (non-target) high-frequency tone and respond to the rare
2022 Gogisetti et al. Cureus 14(8): e28397. DOI 10.7759/cureus.28397 3 of 23

low-frequency tone (target) by pressing the right footpad as soon as he/she hears the target stimuli. A trial
test for the first 10 stimuli was done on all subjects to familiarize themselves with the test. The detailed
characteristics of P300 and its procedure are explained in Appendix 2.
HMSE and Hindi MoCA
Pre-formed validated questionnaires: HMSE [16] and Hindi MoCA [17] were asked, and scores were recorded.
HMSE and MoCA used are attached in Appendices 3-4.
CRT
The CRT was recorded on already validated Deary-Liewald reaction time software on a computer with
WindowsTM version 8.1 (Microsoft, Washington). This was designed by Ian J. Deary and programmed by
David Liewald, with several iterations between the initial design and the final program was used here.
Details of CRT are given in Appendix 5.
Statistical analysis
Signal Analysis
All the trials of P300 waves were averaged in each session. Peak amplitudes (micro-volts - μV) and latencies
(milliseconds - ms) were obtained relative to a pre-stimulus baseline. Data from Cz and Fz electrodes were
considered for analysis. All the values were expressed as mean ± SD. A p-value <0.05 is considered
significant. All statistics were done with the help of SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Mean,
median, and frequency percentages were calculated for descriptive statistics. An unpaired t-test is applied
between hypertensives and normotensives. Similarly, the same test is applied between males and females.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied between age groups and also in education groups. Chi-square is
applied to see the association between gender and education. Pearson correlation is applied to see the
correlation between the variables. The correlation coefficient is expressed as r-value along with p-value.
Results
In our study, 31 hypertensive subjects were compared with 31 normotensive subjects regarding cognitive
parameters. They were analyzed based on age, gender, education, BMI, and BP status, including the duration
of hypertension in hypertensives, as given in Table 1.

Discussion
The implication of hypertension on the cognitive decline has varied results in the previous studies [5-7].
However, all the studies that used ERPs to evaluate cognitive dysfunction proved its effect with
electrophysiological evidence [18-21].
Hypertensives and normotensives did not significantly differ regarding demographic variables in our study.
Age, sex, education, and handedness were matched to remove their confounding effect on dependent
variables (cognitive function parameters). BMI was significantly higher in the hypertensive group. Except for
the BMI and hypertension status, other independent variables (including age, age group, sex, and education
level) did not significantly differ between the two groups.
The mean age group of the individuals was 43.29 (±7.84) years in hypertensives and 41.81 (±7.76) years in
normotensives. Some 80.6% of individuals were of age 35-54 years. This age group was considered for study
since age >65 years itself has more implications on cognitive decline.
Hypertensives and normotensives significantly differed in Cz P300, Fz P300, Fz N100, and Fz N200 latencies.
No other parameters, including HMSE scores, Hindi MoCA scores, reaction times in CRT including correct
reaction time, reaction time, or wrong attempts, did not differ significantly between the groups. This shows
the effect of hypertension on cognition which is represented here by the prolongation of ERP wave latencies.
This effect is not evident in HMSE, Hindi MoCA, and CRTs. The increase in P300 latencies is well
documented in previous studies [18-21], and also increase in N200 latencies is shown in studies done in the
past by Si et al. and Akhtar et al. [22-23].
Mini-Mental Status Examination has a sensitivity of 18% to detect mild cognitive impairment. Though
MoCA has higher sensitivity of 100%, its specificity falls to 82% and has a chance of false positivity. Though
2022 Gogisetti et al. Cureus 14(8): e28397. DOI 10.7759/cureus.28397 11 of 23

MoCA is found to be a reliable screening tool for cognitive impairment, its validity in low-income countries
is still questionable, where the literacy rate is low [24]. HMSE and Hindi MoCA are significantly associated
with a patient’s education level and are not sensitive to recognizing early cognitive deficits. These cognitive
deficits are expected to be not very evident in the early years of hypertension to be picked up in HMSE and
Hindi MoCA [17].
Several studies done previously interpreted similar results [18-21]. Few showed a significant decrease in
amplitude, but our study did not reproduce such results. The advantage of easy reproducibility and
reliability can make this ERP test a standard test to pick up early cognitive deficits [25]. Moreover, it is a
non-invasive test that can favor patients’ compliance for follow-up studies. The results did not show
conflictive evidence compared to previous studies [18-21]. The association of hypertension with cognitive
deficits, though, lacks unanimous conclusions as low BP also proved to be a risk factor for the same [26], but
all the studies done with the help of ERP showed a positive association of hypertension with cognitive
deficits.
Individuals with all levels of education status, including illiterates to post-graduates, were included in the
study. As matching was done, there was no difference between the groups. HMSE and Hindi MoCA were
significantly associated with the association of education with dependent variables. There was a strong
positive correlation between these scores with education. The association of education with these tests has
already been a fact [27]. A similar association was found with CRT, primarily due to the usage of computers.
Hypertension significantly affects cognition, which can be picked up early with the assistance of ERP. The
use of MMSE and MoCA scales is primarily dependent on the education level of the subject. Though Hindi
versions of both the tests were used in the study, they could not help in detecting early cognitive deficits by
eliminating the confounding effect of education. Nevertheless, the use of ERP in detecting cognitive deficits
that very early seem to be promising in the near future. Similar conclusions are made by Papaliagkas et al. in
a similar study [28]. The effect of hypertension treatment on cognition has also been recently studied, and
we have supportive data that treatment of hypertension has decreased the risk of cognitive impairment [29].
Though the treatment of cognitive deficits that are already established is not well known, identifying the risk
factors and preventing the dreaded complication is a very effective way of dealing with it and a cost-
effective solution. The future is promising regarding the development of tools with the help of artificial
intelligence to fight cognitive impairment and reverse at least to some extent though it is in its nascent
stage right now [30].
Limitations
The additional use of the Pz electrode for studying P300 would have helped in better understanding, and
generalized results would have conveyed the reproducibility of findings in all the electrodes. A larger sample
size would definitely increase the power of the study, as the prevalence of hypertension in the population is
high. A follow-up study would firmly establish the association and causation of hypertension in cognitive
impairment.
Conclusions
The effect of hypertension on cognitive impairment is evident and can be objectively proved early in its pre-
clinical stage using event-related potentials. Screening for pre-clinical cognitive deficits can significantly
change cognitive disorders' course. Early identification can help specify high-risk individuals and thus can
either help us alter modifiable risk factors or guide us in deciding on any intervention for treatment or
prevention. As ERPs alone have the potential in the current era to catch very early deficits, they can be
considered a game changer in dealing with cognitive disorders. They are beneficial in screening and
diagnosing and can help assess cognition as a reliable tool to show the effect of treatments/interventions on
cognitive defects. Clinical use of ERPs, which are now being used chiefly as experimental tools, must be
revisited, encouraged, and inculcated in practice to prevent cognitive dysfunctions in hypertensive subjects.
Early screening and a multimodal non-pharmacological approach focusing on good sleep quality, assessing
heart rate variability, and screening for cognitive deficit should be adopted in treating hypertension to
prevent the neglected long-term complications of hypertension for a good quality of life.

Guidelines were practised as guided by Picton. Subjects were informed about the procedure the day before
the scheduled ERP test on a phone call and advised for a head bath on the day of testing and to abstain from
caffeine and alcohol for 24 h before the test. They were allowed to take their routine medication (like anti-
hypertensives in subjects who are already on them). Newly diagnosed cases of hypertension and those
hypertensives who are not started on medication till the test are advised to start medication as advised after
the test.
After explaining the procedure in the lab (Electrophysiology lab) he/she was seated comfortably, the
procedure was explained and informed consent for doing the electrophysiological study was taken from each
subject (Figure 8).

the room were either switched off or kept in silent mode during the procedure. The skin over the electrode
site was cleaned with Nuprep® gel and electrodes were attached using Konix® paste in the electrode
placement site (Figure 9).

Pure silver disk electrodes (Nihon Kohden) were used. The electrodes were attached according to the
standard protocol and the test was run after giving the necessary instructions to the patient. Skin-electrode

impedance was reduced to 5KW or less. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes open as the closing of eyes
can lead to alpha waves in EEG which can contaminate the response waveform. Odd-ball paradigm was
applied in the test, where two types of auditory stimuli (two different frequencies→ targets and non-
target) were given to the subject and he/she needs to ignore the frequent (non-target) high-frequency tone
and respond to the rare low-frequency tone (target) by pressing the right footpad as soon as he/she hears the
target stimuli. The frequency and probability of the stimuli are described below. The timing and probability
of the stimuli were automated in the software. A trial of test for the first 10 stimuli was done on all subjects
for familiarizing with the test. A repeat test was also done in a
few subjects in view of obtaining better electrophysiological graphs, previously which were having difficulty
with marking and interpreting amplitudes and latencies of N100, N200, P200, and P300. A sample ERP is
given in Figure 10.

· Intensity: 40 dB
· Tone burst rise: 10 ms
· Plateau: 100 ms
· Sensitivity: 20-50 uV/div
· Analysis time: 100 ms/div
· Trigger delay: -1 div
2022 Gogisetti et al. Cureus 14(8): e28397. DOI 10.7759/cureus.28397 15 of 23

· Probability: 80% non-target, 20% target

Participant
§ Position: seated with both arms and back resting
§ Eyes: open
§ Active task: participant needs to press the button by right foot at foot pad on hearing each target stimulus
§ Minimal configuration: Fz, Cz (active negative electrodes channel 1 and channel 2 respectively).
§ Reference: electrode on one ear lobe as an online reference and other on the opposite ear for
offline reference (A1 and A2 positive electrodes).
§ Ground: Fpz
Marking
• N100: negative peak at around 100 ms
• N200: next negative peak between 150 ms and 300 ms
• P200: positive peak usually between N100 and N200 and before P300 between 100 m and 300 ms
• P300: positive peak after 200 ms-500 ms after P200
• Amplitude: voltage difference between N100 and P300, N200 and P200 were measured.
Response times were generated depending on the time taken in milliseconds from stimulus to motor
response that is from hearing the target stimulus to pressing the right foot pad. Mean response time, and
minimum and maximum response times were given automatically by the software in the results. Missed hits
were calculated by the number of missed motor responses.
Rejection criteria for waveforms
• Waveforms with no markable positive or negative peaks and with no significant amplitude (0 uV) for
up to three trials
• High background noise
• >6 missed hits for up to five trials

Choice reaction time
The Choice reaction time was recorded on already validated Deary - Liewald reaction time software on a
computer with WindowsTM version 8.1. This was designed by Ian J. Deary and programmed
by David Liewald, with several iterations between the initial design and the final program that was
used here.
All the testing was carried out at a fixed time in the morning (9 am-12 pm) to avoid the confounding effect of
the circadian rhythm. Four white squares appear in a horizontal line across approximately
the middle of the computer screen, set against a blue background. Four keys on a standard computer
keyboard correspond to the different squares. The position of the keys corresponds in alignment to the
position of the squares on the screen: the ‘z’ key corresponds to the square on the far left, the ‘x’ key to the
square second from the left, and the ‘comma’ key to the square second from the right and the ‘full-stop’ key
to the square on the far right. The stimuli to respond appear in a diagonal cross within one of the squares.
Participants are instructed to gently rest the index and middle fingers of their left hand on the ‘z’ and the ‘x’
keys, and the index and middle fingers of their right hand on the ‘comma’ and ‘full stop’ keys. A cross
appears randomly in one of the squares and participants are asked to respond as quickly as possible
2022 Gogisetti et al. Cureus 14(8): e28397. DOI 10.7759/cureus.28397 18 of 23

by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. Each cross remains on the screen until one of the four
keys is pressed, after which it disappears and another cross appears shortly after. The inter-
stimulus intervals range between 1 and 3 seconds and are randomized within these boundaries. The
computer program records the response times for each cross, the inter-stimulus interval for each trial, which
key was pressed and, in the case of four-choice reaction time, whether the response was correct or wrong, a
sample of CRT response is given in Figure 13.
FIGURE 13: Sample of CRT screenshot.
A - sample CRT screenshot where ‘x’ or ‘2’ to be pressed; B - inter-stimulus screen in CRT; C - sample CRT
screenshot where ‘,’ or ‘3’ to be pressed
CRT, choice reaction time
For the ease of illiterates and subjects not accustomed to computers, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’ keys, were used, instead
of ‘z’, ‘x’, ‘,’(comma), ‘.’(full-stop) keys. The same is taken care of for both hypertensives and controls. The
reaction times including correct response time, wrong response time, the number of wrong attempts and
inter-stimulus interval were automatically saved in excel format by the software.

TABLE 5: Auditory ERPs among the various education levels.
Latencies, potentials, and response time of the ERP waves of both Cz and Fz electrode were compared between the education levels by ANOVA followed
by post-hoc Bonferrini tests. In latencies only Fz N200 showed significant difference between the education groups with lower latency periods in higher
education categories and longer latencies in lower education groups. But this test when subjected to Bonferrini test did not yield any statistically different
results in between the groups. No statistically significant difference was found in the groups between HTs and NTs with regard to potentials.
Similar to reaction time derived in CRT, response time showed statistically significant difference between the education groups including mean response
time and maximum response time, although minimum response time did not show statistically significant different results. All these parameters were
slower in less educated subjects. On applying Bonferrini test, the significant difference was found between illiterates and post-graduates in mean and
maximum response time, with higher response times in illiterates compared to post-graduate.

Abstract
Objectives: High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, a major risk factor for death and disease, is pervasive among older
adults. While reducing BP to targeted levels can prevent adverse outcomes, rates of successful BP control remain subop-
timal, and it is unclear whether older adults recognize its proven benefits. The current study sheds light on older adults’ be-
liefs about the consequences of hypertension and benefits of BP control by examining how their self-reports of hypertension
diagnosis and BP control, as well as measured BP, contribute to subjective life expectancy (SLE), their perceived probability
of surviving to a target age.
Methods: In a representative sample of U.S. adults aged 50–89 from the 2006–2014 Health and Retirement Study
(n = 18,979 respondents), we analyze SLE using generalized linear regression.
Results: Diagnosed hypertension is associated with lower SLE, regardless of measured BP. Among diagnosed hypertensives,
those who self-report controlled BP expect to live longer than those who do not. Finally, about 1 in 10 older adults have
high measured BP but have never been diagnosed with hypertension, and most diagnosed hypertensives with uncontrolled
measured BP self-report their BP as controlled.
Discussion: Older adults appear to recognize the harmful effects of hypertension and the benefits of BP control, but often
lack knowledge of their own hypertension and BP control statuses. Health communications should continue to stress the
value of BP control, although improvements may require increased hypertension awareness and BP monitoring.

et al., 2017; Ostchega et al., 2020) and among whom high
BP may contribute not only to cardiovascular disease and
related mortality, but also to cognitive and functional de-
cline (Buford, 2016). Using nationally representative data
from older U.S. adults, we identify three novel findings.
First, we uncover a striking degree of concern for lon-
gevity among older Americans diagnosed with hyperten-
sion. More precisely, those who have been diagnosed with
hypertension are less likely to believe they will survive
to a target age than those without a diagnosis, regard-
less of whether their measured BP is high. Results from
multivariable models suggest this is not due to correl-
ated sociodemographic and health-related factors alone.
Furthermore, when using fixed effects to hold constant
time-invariant individual characteristics, a significant neg-
ative effect of hypertension diagnosis on SLE remains, sug-
gesting that being diagnosed with hypertension compels
people to adjust their survival expectations downwards.
Second, we find that among those with a hypertension
diagnosis, those who self-report their BP as controlled have

Our findings are relevant to prior research on the
wide-ranging impacts of diagnostic labeling. Medical
sociologists have long observed the importance of di-
0.57
agnosis for subjective experiences of health and illness
(Brown, 1995; Conrad & Barker, 2010). While a diag-
nosis can legitimate an illness in the eyes of others, it
may also provoke anxiety and fear, negatively affecting
psychological well-being independently of disease-related
0.49 limitations and symptoms (Ogedegbe, 2010). CSM re-
search likewise finds that perceiving a health condition
to have potentially dire consequences can adversely af-
fect mental health as well as disease-specific outcomes
through denial and avoidance (Hagger et al., 2017).
Health communications that emphasize the efficacy and
availability of hypertension treatment may offset the neg-
ative mental health impacts of diagnosis and encourage
health agency among patients.
Several limitations to the current study warrant men-
tion. To ascertain objective hypertension and BP control
statuses, we use average BP from three readings taken
during a single interview for the HRS. This may result in
some misclassification, as clinical guidelines recommend
two or more separate office visits to diagnose hypertension
(Chobanian et al., 2003). However, the BP collection pro-
cedures followed for the HRS are similar to those used for

INTRODUCTION Wijemunige et al. 2
Global Heart
In most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of cardiovascular diseases is DOI: 10.5334/gh.1174
increasing [1], reaching 16% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 [2]. In Sri Lanka, this
burden is even higher at 29% of DALYs, while ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes mellitus
accounted for 38% of mortality in 2019 [2]. In high-income countries, these conditions caused 21%
of DALYs and 27% of mortality [2]. Screening for these diseases and their risk factors can hasten
diagnosis, treatment, and control, and substantially reduce premature, avertable mortality [3].
Diagnosis and management of hypertension, diabetes, and high-risk of CVD are considered ‘best-
buys’ [4], and is an important component of the Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease
Interventions for Primary Health Care in Low Resource Settings (PEN) [5]. In programs screening
for high-risk of CVD, risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, are
detected and treated, which by extension, treats and reduces CVD risk [5].
In 2016, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Health (MOH) set targets to reduce the prevalence of hypertension
by 25% and to reduce mortality due to diabetes and CVD by 20% by 2025 [6]. It has set up 1,000
dedicated clinics–Healthy Lifestyle Centres–capable of screening nearly one million people
a year for risk factors which lead to CVD [7–9]. The screening assesses hypertension status,
diabetes status, and CVD risk in people aged 35 and over without pre-existing CVD [9]. While
numbers screened have been increasing, only 605,000 people (7% of the target population)
were screened in 2019, and only 28% of those screened were male [9].
Despite the potential for opportunistic screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors at routine
medical consultations to deliver cost-effective interventions that help reorient primary care
toward management of chronic diseases, it is not common in LMICs [3, 10]. In Sri Lanka, where
there is frequent use of outpatient (OP) care–around seven to eight visits per person per year [11]–
opportunistic screening can potentially reach a much larger proportion of the target population.
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness, cost, and distributional impact of an
opportunistic screening program for high-risk of CVD, along with hypertension, diabetes
and hypercholesterolemia, implemented through OP visits of Sri Lankans aged 40 years and
older without pre-existing CVD, and without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes or
hypercholesterolemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SURVEY DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS
We modelled the screening program using data on prevalence of CVD-related chronic
conditions, their diagnoses, and healthcare utilization from the 2018/2019 Sri Lanka Health
and Ageing Study (SLHAS). This was a nationally representative, stratified, multi-stage cluster
random sample of adults aged 18 years and older. Participants attended a field clinic close to
their residence where a questionnaire was completed and biomarkers were measured [12]. A
medical history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and CVD was taken, along
with self-reported use of healthcare and medication. Medical records, if brought to the field
clinic, were checked for medications prescribed and diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia or CVD.
Each participant had their blood pressure (BP) measured, fasting blood glucose, and lipid
profiles (see Supplement 1). Most participants were asked how many OP visits they made to
various types of healthcare facilities in a 28-day recall period. Others were randomly assigned
to report OP visits in one of two other recall periods.
CLASSIFICATION
For the modelling exercise, we used the data on biomarkers, reported diagnoses and medication,
medical records and criteria given in Table 1 to determine whether each participant had and
was already diagnosed with any of three chronic conditions: i) hypertension, ii) diabetes, and iii)
hypercholesterolemia or high-risk of CVD. A participant was ‘undiagnosed’ if they fulfilled any
criterion for ‘has condition’ but did not satisfy any criterion for ‘already diagnosed’. We grouped
hypercholesterolemia and high-risk of CVD together as one condition since either is sufficient to
prescribe statins according to respective guidelines [12]. Participants with pre-existing CVD, which we

defined as participants who reported or had medical records consistent with having been diagnosed Wijemunige et al. 3
Global Heart
with angina, coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, were not eligible for screening.

We identified OP visits to public and private specialist clinics, public and private general clinics,
and public Medical Officer of Health clinics as those at which opportunistic screening could
potentially be initiated.
INTERVENTION
We modelled a screening process (Figure 1, Supplement 1) that incorporates steps specified in the
Sri Lankan Ministry of Health guidelines for screening [12]. It begins with simple questions, similar
to those asked in the SLHAS survey, for people without preexisting CVD, to ascertain whether a
patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. Negative answers trigger
a further set of questions or BP measurement and ordering of a fasting glucose or cholesterol test,
as appropriate. In most cases, a second follow-up appointment is arranged, either at the same
clinic for a regular patient or at a nearby Healthy Lifestyle Centre, to repeat measurement of BP,
review fasting glucose and cholesterol results, calculate CVD risk based on these measurements,
diagnose hypertension or diabetes, determine whether a statin is required based on cholesterol
and/or predicted CVD risk and explain the management plan to the patient where needed.
Figure 1 Processes of the
screening program for people
without preexisting CVD.

We modelled a national program in which initial screenings would take place within a 28-day Wijemunige et al. 4
Global Heart
period which could be pitched as a CVD-riskscreening month. We assumed that screening
DOI: 10.5334/gh.1174
would occur in 60% of OP visits to public facilities and 55% of OP visits to private clinics. These
rates were based on estimates that process quality of care indicators, such as measuring BP
in a known hypertensive patient or measuring blood glucose in a diabetic patient, were met in
70% and 65% of relevant OP consultations in the public and private sectors, respectively [13].
This parameter was changed in sensitivity analyses.
In addition to a 28-day program, we modelled a program that would run less intensively for one
year. In this program, we assumed screening would occur in 30% and 28% of OP visits to public and
private facilities (that is, half the probability of the 28-day model), respectively. This program would
place less demands on the day-to-day operation of clinics, but it would run over a longer period.
We assumed that 60% of those who would be screened in both the 28-day and one-year
programs would attend a follow-up visit irrespective of health status, sociodemographic
characteristics, and type of facility initially visited, with this parameter varied in sensitivity
analyses from 40% to 80%. A small intervention trial in the US, found that over 60% of
participants who were screened and had been told they were at elevated risk for CVD had
visited a doctor within three months [14].
OUTCOMES
The main outcomes were the number of people newly diagnosed with any of the three chronic
conditions, this number as a proportion of those who would remain undiagnosed without the
program, and the cost per person newly diagnosed. In secondary analysis, we estimated the
number and proportion newly diagnosed for each of the three conditions separately.
CALCULATIONS
We used binomial probabilities to calculate the probability that a participant would get the initial
screen based on the number of OP visits reported over a 28-day period (Supplement 1). For the
one-year program, we did not have data on OP visits over a one-year period. Separately for public
and private OP visits and by age, sex, and socioeconomic group, we estimated the proportion of
participants that would have an OP visit in a year by extrapolating from a model of how the probability
of having an OP visit varied for a seven-day, a 14-day and a 28-day recall period (see Supplement 1).
The number of patients screened was calculated by multiplying each participant’s sample weight
() by their probability of being screened () and summing over all participants. The weights scale
the sample and make it representative of the population of Sri Lanka aged 40 years and over. We
then calculated the number of patients followed-up by multiplying the number screened by the
probability of follow-up (0.6). For each of the chronic conditions, the number of people that would
be newly diagnosed by the screening program was the number followed-up who were identified
to have that condition using the biomarker data but who were previously undiagnosed (Table 1).
We also calculated the proportions of people with a chronic condition according to biomarker
data but were undiagnosed and would be newly diagnosed by the screening program. For each
chronic condition, we calculated how many were already diagnosed, how many would be newly
diagnosed in the 28-day program, how many would be additionally diagnosed in the one-year
program, and who would not be diagnosed in either program.
Following the same general procedure, we calculated the number of newly diagnosed cases
identified through opportunistic screening at OP visits to public and private facilities separately.
The weight of a participant who visited both sectors was distributed proportionately based
on the number of visits to each sector and the respective probability of screening. Costs were
calculated separately for the public and private sectors. Costs for the public sector were from
a government budgetary perspective, and covered consumable, reagent and labour costs for
laboratory testing and the cost for a follow-up visit. Costs for the private sector were from
a patient perspective, covering prices of laboratory tests and the cost for a follow-up visit,
although private sector doctors often do not charge when followingup reports ordered at a
previous appointment. Costs were based on prices quoted in the public and private sectors in
2021, which were converted to December 2021 US dollars (US$1 = LKR 201.40) [15].

We used concentration curves and concentration indices [16] to assess socioeconomic Wijemunige et al. 5
Global Heart
inequality in the distributions of undiagnosed cases before and after the opportunistic screening
DOI: 10.5334/gh.1174
intervention, and to measure inequality in the distribution of newly diagnosed cases. We proxied
socioeconomic status by a wealth index equal to the first principal component from analysis
of a battery of household durable assets, housing quality, water and sanitation facilities, and
other assets (Supplementary Table 3). A concentration curve traced the cumulative proportion
of undiagnosed cases, for example, against the cumulative proportion of the sample ranked
from the poorest according to the wealth index to the richest. A concentration curve above
(below) the 45-degree line of equality indicates a disproportionate concentration of cases
among the poor (rich). We measured inequality using a concentration index appropriate for
a binary outcome [17]. A negative (positive) concentration index indicates inequality in the
direction of the poor having more (less) of the outcome. We used a two-sample z-test to test
a null hypothesis of equal proportions of newly diagnosed (or undiagnosed) between groups
defined by the poorest and richest quintiles of the wealth index distribution.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
For both the 28-day and one-year programs, we evaluated the impact of varying the assumed
probability of follow-up from 60% to 80% and 40%. We also modelled a one-year program that
would have the same screening probabilities and so be as intensive as the 28-day program.
RESULTS
Out of 6,668 participants aged 18+, 4,564 were aged 40+, and 4,035 of those in this age group
had no history of CVD (Figure 2). After the loss of 63 participants with no data on OP visits, there
were 3,972 participants in the analysis sample. Of these, 2,380 had data on OP visits in the
past 28 days and were used to model the 28-day program. In this sub-sample of 2,380 people,
730 (31%) had at least one chronic condition that was undiagnosed (Table 2). Among those
with an undiagnosed chronic condition, around 63% (458/730) had undiagnosed hypertension,
31% (228/730) had diabetes, and 33% (241/730) had hypercholesterolemia or high CVD risk. Of
these 730 participants, 176 (24.1%) had more than one undiagnosed condition.

With a less intensive one-year program that would screen lower proportions of those with OP
visits, we estimated that about 4.5 million (95% CI: 4.37, 4.60) patients would be eligible for
screening, and 3.7 million (95% CI: 3.59, 3.78) of them would be assessed, with 17.0% (95%
CI: 15.8, 18.2) of those assessed (627,531/3,682,674) being newly diagnosed with at least one
chronic condition (Table 3).
The 28-day program would identify 8.0% (95% CI: 6.1, 9.8) of undiagnosed hypertensives,
7.4% (95% CI: 5.2, 9.6) of undiagnosed diabetics and 8.7% (95% CI: 6.2, 11.3) of those with
undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia or high CVD risk, in the population aged 40 years or more
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table 4). Overall, 8.2% (191,959/2,331,756) (95% CI: 6.8, 9.6) of
people with any undiagnosed chronic condition would be diagnosed. The one-year program
was estimated to detect 26.9% (627,531/2,331,756) (95% CI: 26.5, 27.4) of people with any
undiagnosed chronic condition. Males would comprise 42% (279,634/666,493) (95% CI: 37, 47)
of those screened and followed-up (Supplementary Table 5).
With the 28-day program, the cost to the government per person screened in the public sector
was estimated to be US$1.01 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.13), and the cost per person diagnosed was
US$7.05 (95% CI: 6.24, 7.85) (Table 3). The costs in the one-year program are similar, where
the public cost per person screened is US$1.17 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.20) and cost per diagnosis is
US$6.82 (95% CI: 6.61, 7.03). The estimated total cost to the government was US$867,000
with the 28-day program and US$2,555,000 with the one-year program (Table 3), which is
0.07% and 0.21% of total public health expenditure in 2019, respectively [18]. The out-of-

pocket costs for patients in the private sector was estimated to be US$2.64 (95% CI: 2.32, 2.97) Wijemunige et al. 7

per person screened in the 28-day program and US$2.87 (95 CI: 2.78, 2.96) in the one-year

program, with the total spent being the equivalent of 0.12% and 0.35% of total private health
expenditure, respectively [18] (Supplementary Table 6).

chronic condition. Point estimates indicate that the percentage with an undiagnosed chronic
condition was higher in the poorest quintile than in the richest quintile, although this difference
is not significant (32.5% vs 29.5%, p = 0.4). The negative concentration index (C) (-0.11; 95%

Estimates for the sensitivity analyses are shown in Supplementary Table 5 and 6. The cost
per person diagnosed ranged from US$6.44 to US$7.73 in the public sector and US$15.03
to US$25.75 in the private sector. A more intensive one-year program, where probability of
assessment was doubled to 60% in the public sector and 55% in the private sector, marginally
increased the percentage of newly diagnosed cases from 27% to 32%, with the total cost to
the government increasing by a similar amount (16%). The program with the most impact
is a one-year program with high probabilities of screening per encounter (60% in the public
sector and 55% in the private sector), as well as a high follow-up rate of 80%. Such a program
would newly diagnose 42% of undiagnosed cases; the costs per person diagnosed is similar
to the one-year base case, and the total cost for the public health sector would be 0.31% of
the 2019 annual expenditure on health by the government. The cost per person diagnosed in
the government sector reduced by 5% if the follow-up rate increased from 60% to 80%, and
increased by about 10% if the follow-up rate reduced from 60% to 40% in both the 28-day
and one-year scenarios. For example, in the one-year scenario where the probability of being
screened is 30% in the public sector and 28% in the private sector, if the probability of follow-
up was lowered from 60% to 40%, the proportion of undiagnosed people that would be newly
diagnosed over the course of the year reduces from 27% to 18%, with a 10% increase in the
cost per diagnosis from US$6.82 to US$7.53.
DISCUSSION
Opportunistic screening at healthcare encounters has been proposed to increase detection of
chronic conditions in LMICs [3, 19]. However, there was a lack of evidence on the effectiveness,
cost, and distributional impact of such.
Our study finds that opportunistic screening could moderately increase the detection of people
with undiagnosed chronic conditions. With a pragmatic 28-day program in which 60% of OP
patients at public clinics and 55% of OP patients at private clinics would be assessed, and
only 60% followed-up, we estimated that 8% of people with an undiagnosed chronic condition

would be detected. With a one-year program in which the probabilities of assessment on a Wijemunige et al. 9
Global Heart
single encounter were lowered to 30% and 20% for public and private clinics, respectively,
DOI: 10.5334/gh.1174
27% of those with an undiagnosed chronic condition would be detected. Furthermore, the
distribution of new diagnoses was broadly distributionally neutral: overall, the distribution of
people with an undiagnosed chronic condition would become slightly less skewed towards the
poor. The detection of new diagnoses would be slightly pro-poor at public clinics and slightly
pro-rich at private clinics. Whilst the government could introduce screening that is pro-poor in
the public sector, it is likely that there will be spill-on effects in the private sector since most
physicians in the private sector are government doctors engaged in dual practice [13].
A major advantage of opportunistic screening over community-based screening is that
it makes use of doctors and facilities that are already available. Although such a screening
program would require additional resources at several stages, most requirements are likely
to be manageable. First, the initial assessment, which involves asking patients a simple set
of questions, taking physical measurements, and arranging laboratory tests and follow-up,
would require only a slight lengthening of the duration of existing consultations, and could
potentially be carried out by several types of healthcare staff, particularly in the public sector
[20]. Furthermore, screening would take place in only 3.7% of all public OP visits (2.2 million
out of 58.7 million visits in 2019 [9]) in the one-year program. The private sector generally has
longer consultation times, which may be compatible with a quick assessment [13]. Whilst it is
difficult to ascertain the burden on laboratory testing, the envisaged cost of laboratory supplies
for the one-year program in the government sector is 1% of the total government laboratory
supplies expenditure reported in 2019 [9], suggesting it would be feasible to absorb laboratory
testing of publicly assessed participants in the public sector, with labour for testing costed as
well. The number of visits required for follow-up in the public sector would represent, at most,
a 2% increment to the total OP visits in 2019 [9], assuming that they cannot be absorbed into
existing follow-up visits and the underutilized capacity of Healthy Lifestyle Centres of 200,000
patients a year. Though this may require extra planning prior to launching a large-scale
screening program, given that there was a 2.4% annual increase in public OP visits between
2008 and 2019, it is possible the system would be able to absorb the additional follow-up visits
needed [9, 21]. Nevertheless, the cost of follow-up, including personnel, infrastructure and
indirect costs, was included for both sectors.
Even in the intensive one-year screening program, the total cost to the government was
estimated at USD 3,745,000, which is 0.31% of the total annual public health expenditure for
2019 [18]. A one-year program with a modest screening probability can diagnose more people,
at less cost per diagnosis, than a high-intensity one month program.
We modelled a uniform follow-up rate by disease condition because the conditions considered
are largely asymptomatic, and there is no disease-based reason to expect a differential in follow-
up visit rates. However, follow-up rates may vary, particularly by gender and socioeconomic
status. In the sensitivity analysis, higher follow-up rates would reduce the cost per person
diagnosed and proportionately increase the percentage of new diagnoses. However, even a
one-year program with a probability of screening of 30% and 28% per public and private sector
encounter, and a low follow-up rate of 40%, would still newly diagnose 18% of undiagnosed
people, with a marginal increase in cost per diagnosed person in the public sector compared
to the base case. To increase the impact of the program, reduce cost per diagnosis, and ensure
that any expansion of the health system is fully utilized, it is imperative the follow-up rates be
increased as much as possible.
Whilst richer people were more likely to have a chronic condition, poorer people were more
likely be undiagnosed. This is similar to other LMICs [22, 23] with authors hypothesizing that
higher diagnosis rates in the rich may be due to better access to screening [22]. Diagnoses from
opportunistic screening at public clinics would slightly more concentrated on poorer people.
However, poorer people would predominate among those who remained undiagnosed after
opportunistic screening, with the extent of this inequality depending on how intensive the
screening programs in the public and private sectors would be and how much follow-up would
be achieved in each sector and socioeconomic group. The opportunistic screening program
would also likely diagnose a greater proportion of males than is currently the case at Health
Lifestyle Centres. The projected reductions in inequalities in diagnosis are consistent with a

study which found opportunistic screening for hypertension in LMICs would reduce female- Wijemunige et al. 10
Global Heart
male and urban-rural differences in diagnosis of hypertension [10].
DOI: 10.5334/gh.1174
There are several limitations to this study. The estimates of doctor visits for the one-
year program relied on modelling, although a subanalysis suggests that our model gives
a conservative estimate of the number of people who had an OP visit in the past year
(Supplement 1). As Sri Lanka undergoes an economic crisis with a depreciating currency and
foreign exchange shortage resulting in medicine shortages, advocating for screening programs
may be challenging in the short-term [24], given that up to 86% of those assessed would
not be ultimately diagnosed with chronic conditions, and the need for initiating longterm
treatment for those who reach treatment thresholds. However, implementing cost-effective
screening and treatment programs for those with chronic conditions will help reduce the long-
term impact and costs of undiagnosed chronic disease [19]. Lastly, this study does not assess
treatment and control, which are imperative to reduce the burden of disease.
The current community-based screening program for chronic conditions is problematic with
limited penetration and systematic difficulty in reaching men. A key strength of this study is
that it demonstrates that in a country with relatively low health spending, and where each
person on average visits a doctor seven to eight times a year (similar to the OECD average [25]),
and 30% of people eligible for screening have at least one undiagnosed chronic condition, the
use of opportunistic screening for the four chronic conditions could newly diagnose a sizeable
number of people in an equitable way, for relatively low cost.
CONCLUSION
The modelling exercise showed that it would be affordable, likely feasible and effective to screen
opportunistically for people at high-risk for CVD. Furthermore, such a screening program would
address a gender disparity diagnosis by increasing the diagnosis of males disproportionately,
and it would slightly reduce socioeconomic inequality in diagnosis. It is important to assess
whether the public health system would be able to absorb an estimated 2% increase in
outpatient visits arising from the program.

In our treated hypertensive cohort, resistant hypertension was associated with an
increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction, and it appears this burden maybe 2–3 times more in those
with resistant hypertension compared to those without. Concerted efforts to prevent
or promptly treat resistant hypertension in our population will reduce cardiovascular
comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION Abiodun et al. 2
Global Heart
Resistant hypertension (RH) is a cause of considerable cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and DOI: 10.5334/gh.1296
mortality all over the world through cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases [1–7]. It is
associated with increased financial burden due to polypharmacy, and the cost of care of co-
morbidities or complications. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension is not accurately
known globally. This is due to the evolving understanding of RH in the last two decades which
occasioned the use of different definitions and methodologies. However, in the last decade and
a half, consensus definitions have been more specific. In 2007 and 2008, the European and
American guidelines defined RH as failure to achieve blood pressure (BP) control despite lifestyle
modification and use of three or more antihypertensive medications in adequate doses, or four
or more antihypertensive medications with or without BP control [8, 9]. The specificity of present
definitions was made possible by the increased understanding [10] of factors that cause falsely
elevated office BP leading to pseudo-RH. These factors include inaccurate BP measurement,
inadequate antihypertensive medication combinations, medication non-adherence, white
coat hypertension, and treatment inertia [10]. The converse occurs when office BP is falsely
controlled in the absence of out-of-office BP measurement that will show poor BP control.
This is seen in patients with masked hypertension (MH), and this causes underestimation of
RH. In cases where pseudo-resistance is excluded and MH is diagnosed with out-of-office BP
measurement, true RH is said to be present.
In Nigeria and Africa, there is a dearth of information on the true prevalence, risk factors and
CV comorbidities associated with RH. CV comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD),
heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in RH have
been studied extensively in different populations but not in African populations [1–7]. In this
study, we evaluated the prevalence, risk factors and CV comorbidities associated with RH in a
cohort of treated hypertensive Nigerians. This will provide accurate and reliable information for
policymaking and program design aimed at addressing the burden of resistant hypertension
and related comorbidities in Nigeria and Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
All consenting patients attending the cardiology clinics of Federal Medical Centre, Abuja (FMCA)
were consecutively recruited into the Federal Medical Centre Abuja Hypertension Registry
(FMCAHR) between 2016 and 2021. One thousand three hundred and seventy-eight (1,378)
essential hypertensive patients aged 18 years and above were included in this study. All patients
with secondary forms of hypertension including primary kidney diseases were excluded from
this analysis.
The FMCA is a leading tertiary healthcare institution in the federal capital of Nigeria. Abuja
has over one million ethnically diverse inhabitants. Also, nationals of other African nations and
non-Africans domiciled in Abuja access health care in FMCA. All patients gave informed consent
and ethics clearance with registration number FMCABJ/HREC/2017/009 was obtained from the
hospital’s ethics research committee.
CLINICAL INFORMATION
Information was obtained from detailed medical history and examination and stored in an
Excel database. These include age (years), sex, weight (kg), height (cm), body mass index
(BMI) (kg/m2), waist circumference (cm), duration of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM)
(in months and years), first-degree family history of hypertension and DM (parents, siblings
and children), duration of alcohol use (grams and duration of use in years), tobacco use (pack
years), office systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP & DBP) (mmHg) measurements by
nurses and physicians at the first visit and the visit of BP control, number of clinic visits before BP
control, home BP measurements and presence of CV comorbidities and non-CV comorbidities
at recruitment, and on follow-up. Information was collected on all medications including
combinations of antihypertensives.

LABORATORY EVALUATION Abiodun et al. 3
Global Heart
Blood and urine for urinalysis were collected at the hospital laboratory at the first clinic visit and DOI: 10.5334/gh.1296
on follow-up as appropriate for all routine investigations. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) was calculated using the 2021 CKD epidemiology collaboration creatinine equation
(CKD-EPI), and it was used to diagnose CKD when persistently < 60 mls/min/1.73 m2 [11].
A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was carried out on all participants on their first clinic
visit and subsequently, as the need arose by trained technicians according to the American
College of Cardiology guidelines [12]. Schiller AT-102 system (Baar, Switzerland) at a speed of
25 mm/s and 1 mV/cm calibration was used, and ECGs were reported by hospital cardiologists.
Echocardiography was performed on all patients by hospital cardiologists at patients’ first visit
and subsequently as appropriate using General Electric, Model Vivid E9, Horten, Norway with
M5S probe or General Electric, Model S6, Horten, Norway with M4S probe. Measurements were
taken in accordance with recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography and
the British Society of Echocardiography [13, 14].
BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
Blood pressure check using appropriate upper-arm cuff sizes was done by physicians with a
mercury sphygmomanometer (Accosson, London, UK) after 3–5 minutes of rest in a sitting
position. BP recheck was done after a minute, and then recorded down as office BP. SBP and
DBP were measured using Korotkoff sounds I at the first appearance of the heart sounds and V
at the disappearance of the heart sounds respectively. All patients were counselled on lifestyle
modification, adherence, and prescriptions were reviewed by the pharmacy department for
medications that increase BP such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, antacids and sodium-
containing proton pump inhibitors, sympathomimetic agents, steroids, contraceptive pills,
antidepressants, and immunosuppressants.
All patients were encouraged to get the Omron M2 model BP monitor, which underwent
calibration in the clinic, for upper-arm home BP monitoring (HBPM). They were taught by the
physicians to measure their BP after sitting comfortably for at least five minutes. They were to
take three BP readings, one minute apart, in the morning (after urinating) and at bedtime. The
last two BP readings were recorded in their BP diary. The patients were asked to measure their
BP at least three times a week and take daily measurements one week before clinic visit. The
average of the last two BP readings of all daily measurements one week before clinic visit was
recorded as home BP.
ADHERENCE AND FOLLOW-UP
Adherence was determined using prescription and pill count monitoring. Prescriptions were
monitored for processing and dispensing by the hospital pharmacy, and patients brought their
medications to the clinic for sighting and pill count. Patients were seen at two to four weeks
following initial visit, and then monthly until BP control. Doses of medications were titrated
upwards at each visit until optimal or best-tolerated doses were achieved.
DEFINITIONS
• Hypertension was diagnosed by persistent elevation of office BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg [15], use
of antihypertensive medication or prior diagnosis by a physician before referral to our clinic.
• RH was defined as BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite the use of ≥ 3 guideline-recommended
antihypertensive medications including a diuretic (thiazide/thiazide-like), a renin-
angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or
angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]), and a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) at
optimal or best- tolerated doses [15, 16]. RH also included patients on ≥ 4 antihypertensive
medications with a BP of < 140/90 mmHg [16]. RH was confirmed with the use of an
average home BP of ≤ 135/85 mmHg in the week preceding clinic visit. Patients must
have been on antihypertensive medications for more than one month after the first clinic
visit. Those with uncontrolled office BP ≥ 140/90 who were not adherent to lifestyle and
pharmacological treatment, or not on guideline-recommended anti-hypertensive drugs or
with white-coat hypertension were not considered to have RH.

adherence, white coat hypertension, or treatment inertia [10, 16].
• White coat hypertension refers to office BP elevations in the presence of controlled home
or ambulatory BP levels [10, 16].
• Masked hypertension refers to normal office BP levels in the presence of elevated home or
ambulatory BP [10, 16].
• Treatment inertia refers to the use of inadequate doses or non-use of guideline-
recommended BP-lowering drug combinations [10, 16].
• Diabetes mellitus (DM) was diagnosed by fasting blood glucose (FBG) of 7.0 mmol/l
or 2-hour plasma glucose level of 11.1 mmol/l [17], and obesity was diagnosed by a
body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m2 [18]. Dyslipidemia was diagnosed when any change in
lipids (total cholesterol [TC] ≥ 5.2 mmol/l, HDL < 1.0 mmol/l in males and < 1.2 mmol/l
in females, LDL ≥ 3.4 mmol/l, and triglycerides [TG] ≥ 1.7 mmol/l), whether isolated or
combined, was present [19, 20].
• Cardiovascular comorbidities present at first visit or in the course of follow-up were
recorded as follows: HF (HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], HF with mildly reduced
ejection fraction [HFmREF] and HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]), CAD,
CVD, CKD, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and arrhythmias. They were diagnosed by
physicians with appropriate tests in line with guideline recommendations [21–27].
• Alcohol use was defined as current intake of alcohol or cessation of intake of less than
one-year duration.
• Tobacco use was defined as current, passive, or past use of tobacco and tobacco
products.
DATA ANALYSIS
Categorical variables are expressed as proportions and percentages while continuous variables
are expressed as means ± standard deviation or as ranges. The association of variables of all
patients with the presence or absence of RH was tested by chi-squared test and independent
T-test where appropriate. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical data with an expected
cell size of less than 5. Multivariable logistic regression with model-fitting statistics was used
to draw an association between statistically significant predictor and outcome variables from
univariable models. P- value < 0.05 is taken as statistically significant. Data was analyzed using
the SPSS version 26 software for Windows.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants by RH. The mean age was 55.6±12.9
years and there were more females (56.1%) than males (43.9%). More males however had RH
(51.4%). Participants with RH had a significantly longer duration of hypertension compared with
those without (p < 0.001). At the univariate level, CV risk factors such as DM (p = 0.018), obesity
(p < 0.001), and family history of hypertension (p = 0.011) showed significant association with
RH. Fasting blood glucose (p = 0.010) and serum creatinine (p = 0.009) were significantly higher,
and eGFR was significantly lower (p = 0.018) respectively in those with RH compared with those
without RH. Also, office BP at the first visit and control in those with RH were significantly higher
than in those without RH (p < 0.001). The frequency of controlled RH, uncontrolled RH and
combined RH were 12.3%, 3.3%, (p < 0.001) and 15.5% respectively while the frequency of
white coat hypertension was 1.7% (p = 0.073).
The number of antihypertensive medications taken was significantly higher in RH participants
(p < 0.001), and ejection fraction (p = 0.004), HF (p = 0.006), HFrEF/HFmrEF (p = 0.002), HFpEF
(p = 0.002), CVD (p = 0.003), and CKD (p = 0.031) were significantly higher in those with RH.
Patients with RH visited the clinic more times before BP control than non-RH patients (p <
0.001). However, TC, HDL, LDL, TG, alcohol and tobacco use, dyslipidemia, left ventricular mass
index, and CAD were not significantly associated with RH (p > 0.05).

DISCUSSION
The prevalence of combined RH in this study is 15.5%, with 3.3% for uncontrolled RH and
12.3% for controlled RH. To our knowledge, this is the first Nigerian and African RH study to use
guideline-recommended antihypertensive combinations wholly, and the first to examine the
association of RH with CV comorbidities.

Previous African studies on RH revealed that the prevalence of RH range from 4.9 to 19% [28–35]. Abiodun et al. 7

The wide range reflects the different definitions that were used for the different studies, partly

because of the evolving understanding of RH in the last two decades. In a systematic review
and meta-analysis, Nansseu et al. noted that the patients used in the five studies included could
be classified as true RH, controlled RH, or pseudo-RH depending on the definition used [28]. In
the only study in the review that measured out-of-office BP, Yameogo et al. found a prevalence
of 14.6% among 692 hypertensives with office BP of ≥ 140/90 mmHg and ambulatory BP of ≥
130/80 mmHg, but without the use of guideline-recommended antihypertensive combinations
[31]. More recently, Kuntonda et al., in a retrospective cohort study, reported a prevalence of
9.4% for true RH after 24-hour ABPM [29], while in another recent Ghanaian multi-center study,
the prevalence of apparent RH was 18.9% [30]. Our study’s prevalence is within the range of
previous studies but may approximate the true prevalence because of the use of guideline-
recommended antihypertensives, longer duration of hypertension, longitudinal BP control
through optimal or best tolerated antihypertensive doses, and assessment of adherence and
lifestyle modification. Previous studies conducted in African populations also did not make a
distinction between uncontrolled and controlled RH. Globally, the prevalence of RH in treated
hypertensives varies widely from 1.9 to 30% [10, 15] depending on the population studied and
the methodology used. Using the definition of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), it has
been suggested that the true prevalence of RH is likely to be < 10% among treated patients
[10, 15]. Therefore, using the same ESC definition, our study suggests that the prevalence of
uncontrolled RH in a treated hypertensive Nigerian population may be less than 5%. However,
studies have shown that both controlled and uncontrolled RH confer morbidity and mortality
in hypertensive patients [3, 36]. In a cross-sectional study of 470,386 hypertensive individuals
carried out by Sim et al., the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ischemic heart disease,
congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and mortality was higher in those with
controlled and uncontrolled RH compared to those without RH [3]. Sim et al. also reported the
prevalence of uncontrolled RH, controlled RH, and combined RH to be 7.9%, 4.9%, and 12.8%
respectively [36]. The prevalence of controlled and combined RH is higher in our study, and this
may be the result of higher baseline office BP of 160/93 (23/15) mmHg in our study, compared
to 143/74 (20/13) mmHg in their study. This is not surprising because of the lower levels of
awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in African populations compared to non-
African populations [37]. The prevalence of uncontrolled RH is higher in the study by Sim et al.
compared to ours. It is noteworthy that Sim and colleagues did not confirm RH with out-of-
office BP measurements, hence the true prevalence is likely to be lower. Though the prevalence
of uncontrolled RH is lower compared to controlled RH in this Nigerian cohort, both groups are
at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
Risk factors that have been associated with RH in African and non-African populations include
increasing age, obesity, DM, family history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome,
and sedentary living [1–7, 29–35]. In our study, we found that hypertensive patients who
are male, obese, and diabetic are more likely to have RH. With increasing rates of these risk
factors of RH in Nigeria and Africa, this suggests that the burden of RH will continue to rise
with a substantial increase in CV morbidity and mortality. Therefore, strategies geared toward
preventing and treating these risk factors of RH need to be reinforced.
After multivariable adjustment, our study showed that CVD and CKD are two and three times,
respectively, more likely to be present in hypertensives with RH. This is similar to greater risks in
RH compared with non-RH patients in a large ethnically diverse hypertensive population [3, 36].
Data from longitudinal, retrospective, registry, and survey analyses, show that RH is not only
associated with increased CV events and all-cause mortality but also with CHF [1–7]. Our study
showed that compared with those without HF, patients with HF were less likely to have RH while
those with HFpEF were 3 times more likely to have RH than those with other forms of HF. The
higher number of patients in this hypertensive cohort with HFrEF and HFmrEF may account for
the difference between HF and HFpEF. The protective effect of HFrEF has been previously shown
by Jin et al in their study of 1,288 patients admitted for HF in China [38]. Our study showed for
the first time in a Nigerian population that CV comorbidities are more prevalent in hypertensives
with RH. This increased risk of CV morbidities in RH populations implies a higher healthcare and
economic burden. Hence, concerted and collaborative action from the primary care level to
ensure early identification of RH, and prompt referral for specialist care are imperative to reduce
further morbidity and mortality.

The prevalence of white coat hypertension in our study is low at 1.7%. A low prevalence of white Abiodun et al. 8

coat hypertension is expected when office BP is based on repeated measurements as seen in this

study [15]. All the patients with RH in our study had guideline-recommended antihypertensive
combinations. This is the first to our knowledge in Nigeria and Africa, eliminating a common
cause of pseudo-RH in treatment inertia. Our study showed that SPC use (6.4%) was the lowest
of the medication combinations. SPCs are expensive, and our patients mostly paid out of pocket
for their medications. Medication adherence may therefore be jeopardized in patients not well
motivated to take free pills, leading to poor BP control. The use of cheaper generic SPCs may
enhance adherence and BP control consequently. In addition, the incorporation of fourth-line
medications such as mineralocorticoid antagonists, beta blockers, and doxazosin in various
SPCs for RH may greatly enhance adherence. These would lead to a reduction in the morbidity
and mortality associated with RH.
One limitation of our study is that we were not able to confirm adherence with urinary or
serum metabolite testing. We used monitoring of prescription orders and pill count to assess
adherence. As much as 53% of patients were reported to be non-adherent by Jung et al. when
urinary drug or drug metabolite levels were measured in patients referred for uncontrolled RH
[39]. However, biochemical assays are expensive and are not readily available [40]. We used
HBPM to confirm RH in our study instead of ABPM because of the lack of health insurance to
cover the cost of ABPM for most of our patients. Guidelines recommend ABPM and/or HBPM to
confirm RH [15, 16, 41, 42]. Our data on CV comorbidities should be interpreted with caution
because it combined events that were present at recruitment and events that occurred at
follow-up. However, our relatively large sample size, use of recommended guideline medication
combinations, HBPM to confirm RH, and assessment of CV morbidities for the first time in
African patients are strengths of this study. Further studies are needed in Africa to prospectively
ascertain the burden of mortality of RH.
CONCLUSION
This study showed the prevalence of RH including uncontrolled and controlled in a treated
hypertensive Nigerian cohort. This is likely a true representation of RH in Nigerian hypertensives
given that treatment inertia and pseudo-RH were excluded. Patients with RH were more likely
to be male, obese, and diabetic. For the first time in a Nigerian and African cohort, our study
demonstrated the association of RH with CVD, CKD, and HFpEF. Our findings highlight the heavy
burden of RH which calls for early diagnosis of RH to reduce morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) increase the risk of developing
chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Perceptions of stress and neighborhood context also influence blood pressure (BP)
fluctuations. We examined if APOs, higher perceived stress, and neighborhood deprivation were associated with hypertension phe-
notypes a decade after pregnancy in untreated individuals.
METHODS: Participants were 360 individuals who gave birth between 2008 and 2009 and participated in a research study 8–10 years
following pregnancy. Standardized office and home BP readings were obtained, and we applied the AHA/ACC 2017 guidelines to iden-
tify sustained, white coat, and masked hypertension phenotypes. We measured personal stress with the perceived stress scale and
neighborhood deprivation with the CDC Social Vulnerability Index.
RESULTS: Of the 38.3% (138/360) with any hypertension, 26.1% (36/138) reported a diagnosis of hypertension but were currently
untreated. Sustained hypertension was the most common (17.8%), followed by masked and white coat hypertension, both 10.3%.
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were associated with sustained (odds ratio [OR] 5.54 [95% confidence interval, CI 2.46, 12.46] and
white coat phenotypes (OR 4.20 [1.66, 10.60], but not masked hypertension (OR 1.74 [0.62, 4.90]). Giving birth to a small for gestational
age infant was also associated with sustained hypertension. In covariate adjusted models, perceived stress, but not neighborhood
deprivation, was significantly associated with masked hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: A decade after delivery, APOs were associated with sustained and white coat hypertension, but not masked hyperten-
sion. Exploration of the mechanisms underlying, and clinical implications of, these associations is warranted.

Neighborhood deprivation was measured 8–10 years post
birth using the 2018 CDC Social Vulnerability Index consisting
of 4 domains (i.e., socioeconomic status, household composi-
tion, minority status, and housing type) measured at the census
tract level (Supplementary Figure S1 online). Each census tract
is assigned a rank (0–1) relative to the other census tracts in
Pennsylvania, with higher values representing greater depriva-
tion. The index is included in the NIH Structural Determinants
of Health PhenX toolkit and has been used to link neighborhood
deprivation with health factors.12,13,24,25
The perceived stress scale assesses individual-level per-
ceptions of stress in the past month and a higher value rep-
resents greater stress levels.26 The perceived stress scale is
included in the NIH PhenX toolkit as a validated psychoso-
cial measure and demonstrated good reliability in our sample
(α = 0.76).25
Covariates were self-reported age, racial identity, highest edu-
cation attained, and objectively measured body mass index. Body
mass index was calculated from the weight and height measure-
ments at the research visit.
Analysis
The characteristics of the sample were summarized using
descriptive statistics and scatterplots. Data are expressed as
mean ± SD. The distribution of data was assessed using histo-
grams and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality. Differences
in APO, neighborhood, and individual factors by hypertension
phenotype were tested using Chi-square with Fisher correc-
tion as indicated or 1-way ANOVA for continuous variables.

Background & Objectives: Although thiazide diuretics are frequently used to treat hypertension, they
may also raise the risk of syncope and falls. The purpose of this study was to look at the relationship
between hypertension individuals' use of thiazide diuretics and falls or syncope.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study, conducted between March 2019 and March 2024, included
236 individuals with hypertension taking thiazides and 236 controls not taking thiazides. Data from
electronic medical records were extracted, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome
data. The main outcome was the occurrence of syncope episodes or falls. Logistic regression analyses
examined associations between various factors and falls/syncope risk.
Results: The study included 236 study participants taking thiazides (118 men, 118 women) and 236 controls
not taking thiazides (118 men, 118 women). Study participants taking thiazides had a higher prevalence
of hyponatremia (57 study participants, 24.1% vs. 31 study participants, 13.1%), hypokalaemia (52
study participants, 22% vs. 32 study participants, 13.6%), hypercalcemia (37 study participants,
15.7% vs. 17 study participants, 7.2%), metabolic alkalosis (89 study participants, 37.7% vs. 52 study
participants, 22%), acute kidney injury (59 study participants, 25% vs. 30 study participants, 12.7%),
and chronic kidney disease (89 study participants, 37.7% vs. 59 study participants, 25%) compared
to controls (all P<0.05). The prevalence of falls/syncope events was significantly higher in the thiazide
group (76 study participants, 32.2%) compared to the non-thiazide group (46 study participants, 19.5%),
with a P value of 0.002. Multivariate analysis showed increased falls/syncope risk with age [adjusted
odds ratio (AOR)=1.38], congestive heart failure (AOR=2.12), longer thiazide duration (AOR=1.21),
hyponatremia (AOR=1.68), hypokalaemia (AOR=1.72), metabolic alkalosis (AOR=1.68), acute kidney
injury (AOR=1.85), and decreased eGFR (AOR=1.22 per 10 ml/min/1.73m2 decrease).
Interpretation & Conclusion: Thiazide diuretic use in hypertensive patients is related to syncope,
potentially mediated by electrolyte disturbances and renal impairment. These results highlight the
importance of careful monitoring and individualized treatment approaches when prescribing thiazide
diuretics to hypertensive patients.

contributingtothedevelopmentofstroke,myocardialinfarction,heart,andrenalfailure[8],
leadingtoearlydisabilityanddependency,reducingthelifeexpectancyinpatients,and
increasingthecostofcare[9–11].
Amongallthecasesofhypertension, approximately95%ofthemareidentifiedas
essentialhypertension(EH),acomplexmultifactorialhaemodynamicandstructuraldis-
ordercharacterizedbyanoverallincreasedsystolicbloodpressure(SBP)of≥140mmHg
and/ordiastolicbloodpressure(DBP)of≥90mmHg[12,13],resultingfromtheinterplay
ofnon-specificenvironmentalandgeneticfactors[6]. Moreover,thereareconditionsthat,
evenduringpregnancy,couldcontributetothedevelopmentofearlyEH[14]. Inrecent
years,manystudieshavefocusedonthistopic,givinglifetothenowcalled“developmental
originsofhealthanddisease(DOHaD)”.
Physiologically,bloodpressure(BP)valuesremainwithinaphysiologicalrangethanks
toafinebalancemaintainedbetweenfactorsthatcouldincreaseBPandthosethatnormalize
it, working as compensatory mechanisms. It is when this slender and fragile dynamic
stabilityfailsthatEH“appears”[15,16]. EHphysiopathologysurpassestheincreasein
BP;infact,animportantroleisplayedbythedelicatebalancebetweenvasodilatorsand
vasoconstrictors[6]. Whenthisbalanceisdisturbed,itleadstoendothelialdysfunction
with an excessive release of vasoconstrictor substances [6,17,18]. In a second moment
this alteration could lead to structural and functional changes in both the macro- and
micro-structureofthevasculature[19]thatcansometimesresultincompleteventricular
remodelling.
Nexttotheendothelialdysfunction,arterialstiffeningmustalsobeconsideredinEH
etiopathogenesis: it is one of the main responses to chronical stress exerted by dyslipi-
daemia,ageing,andhighBPitself. Thearterialmodulationtoexternalstresslimitsthe
bufferingcapacityoftheelasticarteries,exposesthemicrovasculaturetoincreasedpulsatile
stress,andcontributestotargetedorgandamageviacapillaryrarefactionandmicrovascular
ischemia[19,20],definingageneralworseningoftheoverallclinicaloutcome.
AnotherimportantbackgroundmechanisminEHdevelopment[21]isrepresented
bytheincreasedoxidativestressandalterationsinthetotalantioxidantcapacity(TAC),
whichisatypicalfeatureofmanyotherCVDs[22–25]. Moreover,despitethelargenumber
ofcommerciallyavailableantihypertensivedrugs,thepercentageofpatientswithwell-
controlledBPisnotwhatwewouldexpect,andmanyofthemeitherstoptheirtherapyor
followitpoorly[13,26,27].
Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a ubiquitousand widelydistributed
indoleamine that can be found in almost all living organisms [28]. Melatonin passes
throughthemodulationofthehypothalamic/pituitaryaxesendingwithmorecomplex
functions[29,30]. Overall,itisconsideredoneofthemainantioxidantmoleculesthatcould
workinmanydifferentsituations.
Increasingly,clinicaltrialshavebeendesignedtoevaluatetheactivityofexogenous
melatonin; however, the precise mechanism(s) by which it acts in hypertense patients
is not completely clear, and its link with the pathogenesis of EH development remains
controversial[31,32].
Moreover,mostofthestudiesconducteduptonowhavebeencarriedoutforalimited
period(90days)andwithastandarddosageofabout5–6mg/dieofmelatonin[5,33,34].
Wedecidedtocarryoutthisrandomizedclinicaltrialinorderto(1)betterevaluate
the connection between plasmatic oxidative status and vascular conditions in essential
hypertense patients; (2) understand if the continued administration of a lower dosage
ofmelatonin(accordingtotheEthicsCommittee,1mg/dieisthemaximumdosagethat
shouldbeadministeredasanadditiontothepharmacologicalanti-hypertensivetherapy)
foralongerperiodoftime(1year)couldbebeneficialnotonlyclinically,butalsotothe
structuralchangesinvolvingthemicro-andmacro-vasculatureofhypertensivepatients.

Abstract
For salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH), salt restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors are essential treatments, but their effect on the function of resistance arteries is unclear. Here,
we present an intravital study to detect the effect of salt restriction and ACE inhibitors on the function of
the mesenteric small artery (MSA) in SSH. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were randomized into the following
groups: ACE inhibitor gavage, salt restriction, ACE inhibitor combined with salt restriction, and high-salt
diet. After a 12-week intervention, the mesenteric vessels maintained their perfusion in vivo, and the
changes in the diameter and blood perfusion of the MSAs to norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine
(ACh) were detected. Switching from a high-salt diet to a low-salt diet (i.e., salt restriction) attenuated
the vasoconstriction of the MSAs to NE and promoted the vasodilatation to ACh, while ACE inhibitor
improved the vasodilatation more obviously. Pathologically, changes in local ACE, AT1R, and eNOS
expression were involved in these processes induced by a high-salt diet. Our study suggests that salt
restriction and ACE inhibitor treatment improve high salt intake-induced MSA dysfunction in SSH, and
salt restriction is a feasible and effective treatment. Our findings may provide a scientific basis for the
treatment of hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Despite its clinical significance, the risk of severe infection requiring hospitalization among outpatients with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who receive angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) remains uncertain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a propensity score– matched outpatient cohort (January– May 2020) of 2263 Medicare Advantage
and commercially insured individuals with hypertension and a positive outpatient SARS- CoV- 2, we determined the associa-
tion of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with COVID- 19 hospitalization. In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7933 hospitalized with
COVID- 19, we tested their association with in- hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a con-
temporary cohort (May– August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 0.53– 1.13, P=0.18)
nor ARBs (HR, 0.88; 0.61– 1.26, P=0.48) were associated with hospitalization risk. ACE inhibitors were associated with lower
hospitalization risk in the older Medicare group (HR, 0.61; 0.41– 0.93, P=0.02), but not the younger commercially insured group
(HR, 2.14; 0.82– 5.60, P=0.12; P- interaction 0.09). Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with lower hospitalization
risk in either population in the validation cohort. In the primary inpatient study cohort, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.97; 0.81–
1.16; P=0.74) nor ARBs (HR, 1.15; 0.95– 1.38, P=0.15) were associated with in- hospital mortality. These observations were
consistent in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with COVID- 19 hospitalization or mortality. Despite early evidence
for a potential association between ACE inhibitors and severe COVID- 19 prevention in older individuals, the inconsistency of
this observation in recent data argues against a role for prophylaxis.

Khera et al ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in COVID- 19
risk, overall (HR in propensity-m atched cohorts, ACE
inhibitor, 0.98; 0.76– 1.26; P=0.87, and ARB, 0.77;
0.59– 1.02; P=0.07) or in the Medicare Advantage or
commercially insured population (Figure 2, Table 4).
Among the individuals in the outpatient cohort who
were hospitalized, there was no association with ACE
inhibitor or ARB use with subsequent in- hospital mor-
tality (Table S7).
Mortality in the Inpatient Cohort
Of the 7933 individuals hospitalized with COVID- 19,
1128 (14.2%) died during hospitalization, 4722
(59.5%) were discharged alive, and 2083 (26.3%)
were still hospitalized at the end of the observation
period. A majority of deaths (90.1%) were among
the Medicare Advantage population. The median
length of stay (including individuals who died as well
as those discharged alive) for COVID- 19 hospitali-
zations was 6 (IQR, 3– 11) days, which was similar
across individuals who died (6 (IQR, 3– 10) days) or
were discharged alive (6 [IQR, 3– 11] days) during the
observation period.
Overall, the proportion of COVID- 19 inpatients
who died did not differ significantly in those on ACE
inhibitor therapy before hospitalization compared
with those on other antihypertensive agents (13.5%
versus 13.9%, P=0.68). In the propensity matched–
cohort of individuals receiving ACE inhibitors be-
fore hospitalization (Figures S6 and S7), in- hospital
mortality was not significantly different from that
of individuals on other antihypertensive drugs (HR,
0.97; 0.81–1 .16, P=0.74; Figure 3, Table 3). Similarly,
treatment with ARB did not have a significantly dif-
ferent risk of mortality compared with other antihy-
pertensive agents (1.15; 0.95– 1.38, P=0.15). There
were no significant differences in mortality between
individuals receiving ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the
overall population, without a significant interaction
between insurance group and treatment assignment
and patient outcome (Figure 2, Table 3). These find-
ings were consistent in our secondary outcome of
in- hospital death or discharge to hospice (Table S8).
There was also no association between treatment
with ACE inhibitor or ARB on hospital length of stay
(Table S9). There were no significant differences be-
tween our falsification outcomes in matched groups
(Table S10). There were no significant differences in
mortality across propensity- matched groups of hos-
pitalized patients in the inpatient validation cohort
(Figure 4, Table 4).
Sensitivity analyses that focused on individuals re-
ceiving at least 1 first-l ine antihypertensive agent in the
control group, and that varied the covariate adjustment
strategies, were consistent with the primary analysis
(Tables S11 through S14).

Khera et al ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in COVID- 19
DISCUSSION
In this national study of ACE inhibitors and ARBs
among patients with hypertension in the outpatient
setting testing positive for SARS- CoV- 2, we found that
overall these drugs did not confer additional risk or
benefit. While early data indicated that ACE inhibitors
may be associated with a lower risk of hospitalization
for COVID- 19, more recent data did not demonstrate
this association. Moreover, such an effect was not ob-
served with ARBs. Among inpatients with COVID- 19,
we did not find a benefit or a harm of these medica-
tions. Collectively, the findings do not support a change
to the current use of these medications or evaluating
the use of ACE inhibitors to reduce the risk of severe
SARS-C oV-2 infection.
Our study was restricted to individuals with hyper-
tension who were receiving at least 1 antihypertensive
agent, thereby limiting our assessment to individuals
receiving treatment for the same chronic illness, and
therefore, equally likely to seek care for healthcare
needs for COVID- 19. In all analyses, we explicitly com-
pared individuals with equipoise for receiving either
drug treatment. Moreover, we did not find any evi-
dence of confounding by disease severity in choice of
therapy in our assessment of falsification end points.
Furthermore, our study included individuals from
across the United States, thereby limiting the effect
of hospital or regional care practices that may bias an
evaluation of treatment effects.
Our observations extend the prior evidence
of supporting safety of ACE inhibitor treatment in
COVID- 19.8,13,24 Many studies thus far have had lim-
itations with their data sources and study designs to
adequately address the hypotheses focusing on the
safety of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in COVID- 19, and
their potential efficacy in reducing the severity of the
disease.7,11 Our study adds to the literature by focus-
ing on a large national population spanning the en-
tire adult age range and including individuals across
the United States, thereby overcoming the challenge
of generalizability of studies that are based on single
centers or hospitals in the same region. We show that
these agents are not associated with harm in outpa-
tient SARS- CoV- 2-i nfected individuals and were able
to track the same individuals across different outpa-
tient and inpatient settings. We also use robust meth-
ods to account for confounding. This complements the
studies of those who were hospitalized and focused
on severity of disease and mortality in these patient
groups.13,25
Our original study that focused on data from January
through May had an intriguing finding. In the subgroup
of individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage, we found that ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly
lower risk of hospitalization following an infection with

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

Data S1.
Supplemental Methods
Data Sources and Quality Control
Data entry: Medical and pharmacy claims data are captured, predominantly electronically, from sites of care seeking
third-party reimbursement for both Medicare and commercial plans using the industry standard data collection forms
HCFA/CMS-1500 for facility claims, UB04/CMS-1450 for professional services and outpatient claims, and NCPDP
for pharmacy claims or their electronic equivalents. Structured data from these standardized forms are coded using
the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), National Drug
Codes (NDC), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes
(LOINC) codes, and Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG). This nomenclature ensures consistency of data collection
across geographic regions, health systems, and payers throughout the United States.
Methods to Control for Errors in Sampling & Data Collection: Claims that do not adhere to the form or coding
standards described above are rejected from reimbursement, minimizing the risk that inappropriately structured data
are included in the database. Data specific to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has an additional Quality Control layer
to control for errors in sampling and data collection; this is described below in the Quality Control section.
Data Relevance & Accuracy: Data are transferred into the UnitedHealth Group R&D Data Platform, where a
dedicated team pursues data management to ensure accurate matching of source data to an individual. This protocol
uses unique identifiers to match them to existing identifiers in the UHG R&D Data Platform to determine whether
the individual already exists in the platform. A unique identification number is generated for each individual so that
data from multiple sources can be linked back to that identification number. Individuals that fail to meet the
matching criteria are excluded from the UHG R&D Data Platform to reduce the risk of erroneous linkage of records.
Those whose claims do not fulfill basic standardized data structure requirements described previously are also
excluded. During this, all member protected data are stored in a separate database that is only accessible by a
designated engineering team. In addition to a persistent identifier being generated for each member, a de-identified
primary key is also generated. The de-identified primary key is recycled every 6 months, at which time each
member is assigned a new de-identified primary key. Data that are made available for research through the UHG
Clinical Discovery Database use the de-identified primary key as the link across data tables. All protected
information has been removed, ensuring any research performed is limited to retrospective analysis of de-identified
data and accessed in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations.
Sufficiency of basic data: As described above, individuals lacking enough data to be assigned a unique primary key
are excluded from the UHG Clinical Discovery Database, as are members whose claims did not fulfil basic data
structure requirements. In a given month in 2019, the UHG Clinical Discovery Database contained one or more
claims from 5 million Medicare Advantage enrollees and 20 million commercially insured individuals. Further
information on data sufficiency for the research performed in this manuscript can be found in the study selection
flowsheets (Figure S1 and Figure S2).
Adequacy of possible derived data / Design of computer editing methods: To reduce the risk of introducing error to
standardized, structured claims data, derivation of source data within the UHG Clinical Discovery Database is
minimal. The Data Integration team loads, formats, and join the data to appropriate dimension tables. Dimension
tables are combined with raw claims information to limit the number of times external tables need to be referenced.
Researchers may request derived fields within data tables prepared specifically for a project. This process is
managed by the Data Enrichment team, who creates data dictionaries to accompany derived fields. Tables
containing derived data are stored separately from raw source data. Access to modify/edit source data is restricted to
a subset of data specialists. Each step in the data flow has a restricted list of individuals able to perform any type of
editing to the database, and access level varies by team (Data Integration, Data Enrichment). Researchers using the

UHG Clinical Discovery Database may not edit any source data or enrichment data. They are instead given access to
“sandbox” locations where they may request editing access for the data tables used in their analyses.
Quality control: In addition to the quality control mechanisms described during the matching procedures to reject
non-linkable or inappropriately structured data, a COVID-19 data source-specific layer of quality control is also
present, given the rapidly evolving situation. SARS-CoV-2 lab tests included in the UHG Clinical Discovery
Database exclude custom local codes or codes that are not present in the LOINC organization’s guidance for
mapping SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related LOINC terms. Test information provided via the LOINC code
compliments the test type (antibody, PCR, etc.) as well as the result value (detected, not detected, not
given/cancelled). Members with a qualified COVID-19 related hospital admission are included in the report
when any diagnosis matches qualified ICD-10 codes as defined in Table S1. Suspected COVID-19 inpatient cases
are manually reviewed daily by health plan clinical staff via clinical notes to determine an individual’s COVID-19
status. Each case is then manually flagged as either negative, confirmed, presumed positive, or needs clinical review.
If a case is confirmed, it is not reviewed again. If a case is listed as negative or unknown, it is periodically reviewed
for changes in the record. All others are reviewed and updated daily.
Differences across groups: While the data for Medicare Advantage and commercially insured enrollees is processed
in a similar manner, these groups are substantially different. First, there are systematic differences in patient
characteristics, most remarkably the older age and the higher prevalence of all comorbidities. These differences are
tabulated in Table S3. Second, while Medicare includes all Medicare Advantage enrollees in the UHG Clinical
Discovery Database, there are restrictions from individual employers on these use of data for research. Therefore,
commercial insurance claims that are available for analyses are a subset of the overall commercially insured
population.
Estimation of Propensity Score Model
In both outpatient and inpatient studies, we created propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with hypertension,
treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or other antihypertensive medications. For this, we constructed a non-
parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model with receipt of ACE inhibitors, ARB or other antihypertensive
as the dependent variable. These analyses were conducted across pairs of comparisons. For example, we modeled
the receipt ACE inhibitor or another other antihypertensive (excluding ARB) to determine each patient’s probability
of receiving these agents based on their measured clinical characteristics. For this, the receipt of ACE inhibitor or
other agent (ACE = ‘1’ and Other = ‘0’) was used as a dependent variable in a logistic regression model and used a
set of patient-level covariates as independent variables. These included patient age, sex, race, insurance type,
conditions that may lead to selective use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs (i.e., diabetes, myocardial infarction, heart
failure, and chronic kidney disease), each of the comorbidities in the Charlson Comorbidity Index (peripheral
vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hemi- or paraplegia, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic
disease, diabetes with chronic complications, malignancy, metastatic solid tumor, mild liver disease, moderate-to-
severe liver disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus), and the number of
antihypertensive agents used for the patient. To account for regional clustering of care practices and response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, we explicitly accounted for census region of lab testing site or inpatient facility in our models.
We applied this strategy to different pairs of treatment comparisons (ACE inhibitor vs others, ARB vs others, and
ACE inhibitor vs ARB) to assess the propensity of being treated with either agent in pairwise comparisons.
Matching Algorithm
We used a dedicated algorithm that matched the “cases” to “controls” in one-to-one fashion for each of 3
comparisons - ACE inhibitor vs others, ARB vs others, and ACE inhibitor vs ARB. Such matched pairs were
selected based on propensity scores with a caliper width of one-tenth of the standard deviation of the logit of the
propensity score. The propensity score and matching algorithm were pursued over 100 iterations to find the lowest
mean absolute standardized difference among matched variables.

Evaluation of the Propensity Score Matching
We evaluated the performance of propensity score matching using several strategies.
(1) We assessed the propensity score distributions in the unmatched and matched cohorts and calculated an
equipoise metric to summarize the degree of overlap in characteristics of patients receiving these drugs.17, 40
This represents the proportion of individuals in the unmatched groups that had a propensity score between
0.3 and 0.7, representing a state of equipoise between the two drugs. A value greater than 0.5 implies two
drugs are in empirical equipoise, with a higher a value indicating a lower likelihood of confounding by
indication.40
(2) We evaluated the standardized difference between matched covariates before and after propensity score
matching. Specifically, we evaluated whether our matching algorithm achieved a standardized difference of
<10% between matched cohort suggestive of adequately matched groups.17, 19
(3) We evaluated the success of our matching algorithm using negative control or falsification endpoints. We
chose these negative controls from published data on hypertension drug evaluations using claims data.
These endpoints were defined from the claim records for study participants between January 1, 2019 and
December 31, 2019, and therefore, preceded the infection with SARS-CoV-2.17 The chosen falsification
endpoints were based on the assertion that they are unlikely to be affected by the treatment assignment and
a directional effect would represent covariate imbalance.
These strategies were designed to evaluate the potential for residual confounding after creating propensity score
matched cohorts. Finally, we evaluated our observations for robustness by assessing treatment effects in 100
iterations of the propensity score matching algorithm, evaluating whether our findings were consistent across these
iterations that varied on the degree of matching of individual covariates.

BACKGROUND: This case- control study aimed to determine whether there were differences between patients with essential
hypertension with accessory renal arteries (ARAs) and those without ARAs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The enrolled patients with essential hypertension were divided into the ARA group (n=200) and control
group without ARAs (n=238). After propensity matching, 394 patients (197 in each of the 2 groups), were included. The 24- hour
BP (4.33/2.43 mm Hg) and daytime BP (4.48/2.61 mm Hg) of patients in the ARA group were significantly higher than those of the
control group (P<0.05). The flow- mediated dilation was lower in the ARA group (5.98±2.70 versus 5.18±2.66; P<0.05). In correla-
tion analysis, the horizontal plasma aldosterone concentration had the highest correlation with 24- hour, daytime, and nighttime
systolic BP (r=0.263, 0.247, and 0.243, respectively; P<0.05) and diastolic BP (r=0.325, 0.298, and 0.317, respectively; P<0.05).
As for multivariate regression analysis, plasma aldosterone concentration was a significant risk factor for elevated 24- hour, day-
time, and nighttime systolic BP (β=0.249 [95% CI, 0.150–0.349], 0.228 [95% CI, 0.128–0.329], and 0.282 [95% CI, 0.187–0.377],
respectively; P<0.05) and elevated diastolic BP (β=0.289 [95% CI, 0.192–0.385], 0.256 [95% CI, 0.158–0.353], and 0.335 [95%
CI, 0.243–0.427], respectively; P<0.05). Direct renin concentration was also a risk factor for 24- hour and daytime BPs, whereas
heart rate was a risk factor correlated with 24- hour, daytime, and nighttime diastolic BP (all P<0.05). For the mixed- effects model
for repeated measures, the results were similar to results of the multivariate regression analysis (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: ARAs could contribute a higher BP of patients with essential hypertension and might promote the development
of essential hypertension. The mechanism might be related to overactivation of the renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system and
sympathetic nervous system.

ABSTRACT
Hypertensionisthepredominantcauseofcardiovasculardiseases(CVDs)globally,andessentialhypertension(EH)represents
a significant public health challenge due to its multifactorial etiology involving complex interactions between genetic and
environmentalfactors.However,thepathogenesisofEHisstillunclear.Hypertensionisadysregulationintherenin–angiotensin–
aldosteronesystemandsympatheticnervoussystem,bothregulatingsalinehomeostasisandcardiovascularfunction.However,
current therapeutic interventions targeting these systems have limited efficacy in approximately 40% of cases, suggesting the
involvementofalternativemechanisms.Inflammationisassociatedwiththeoccurrenceandprogressionofhypertension,but
theunderlyingmechanismremainselusive,whilechronicinflammationleadstotissuedamage,fibrosis,andirreversibleorgan
dysfunction. The development and maintenance of EH are caused by endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic
inflammation.Neutrophilsareinvolvedinbothacuteandchronicinflammationsincetheyrepresenttheprimarylineofdefense

Aims Hypertensive patients of African ancestry (Afr-a) have higher incidences of heart failure and worse clinical outcomes than
hypertensive patients of European ancestry (Eu-a), yet the underlying mechanisms remain misunderstood. This study inves-
tigated right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular remodelling alongside myocardial tissue derangements between Afr-a and Eu-a
hypertensives.

Methods 63 Afr-a and 47 Eu-a hypertensives underwent multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Biventricular volumes,

mass, function, mass/end-diastolic volume (M/V) ratios, T2 and pre-/post-contrast T1 relaxation times, synthetic extracel-
lular volume, and myocardial fibrosis (MF) were measured. 3D shape modelling was implemented to delineate ventricular
geometry. LV and RV mass (indexed to body-surface-area) and M/V ratio were significantly greater in Afr-a than Eu-a hyperten-
sives (67.1 ± 21.7 vs. 58.3 ± 16.7 g/m2, 12.6 ± 3.48 vs. 10.7 ± 2.71 g/m2, 0.79 ± 0.21 vs. 0.70 ± 0.14 g/mL, and 0.16 ± 0.04 vs.
0.13 ± 0.03 g/mL, respectively; P < 0.03). Afr-a patients showed greater basal interventricular septum thickness than Eu-a
patients, influencing LV hypertrophy and RV cavity changes. This biventricular remodelling was associated with prolonged
T2 relaxation time (47.0 ± 2.2 vs. 45.7 ± 2.2 ms, P = 0.005) and higher prevalence (23% vs. 4%, P = 0.001) and extent of
MF [2.3 (0.6–14.3) vs. 1.6 (0.9–2.5) % LV mass, P = 0.008] in Afr-a patients. Multivariable linear regression showed that modi-
fiable cardiovascular risk factors and greater end-diastolic volume, but not ethnicity, were independently associated with
greater LV mass.
...................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion Afr-a hypertensives had distinctive biventricular remodelling, including increased RV mass, septal thickening and myocardial
tissue abnormalities compared with Eu-a hypertensives. From this study, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and ventricu-
lar geometry, but not ethnicity, were independently associated with greater LV myocardial mass.

regarded as a disease of low prevalence in the developing world, however, recent studies have shown
that it is a huge burden for developing countries with increased risk of adverse outcomes [4,5]. A
pooled analysis of global trends in blood pressure from 1975 to 2015 reveals that the highest levels
of BP have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in South Asia and Sub-Sa-
haran Africa (SSA) [6].
Previous studies on hypertension in Ghana have reported increases in prevalence and its significant
effects on cerebro-vascular accidents (CVA), as well as coronary heart disease’s (CHD) morbidity and
mortality in recent years [7,8]. These increased prevalence might be attributable to multiplicity of
factors such as staying in urban areas and ageing [9,10].
In 2017, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) came out
with the current Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High BP
in Adults. This latest guideline decreased the cutoffs for the definition BP. It describes the condition
as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg, this is 10 mm Hg lower than the previous cut-off points.
This lower threshold was categorized as the pre-hypertensive range per the previous guidelines; the
recent guideline replaced the term “prehypertension” with “elevated blood pressure”[11].
Earlier guidelines, such as the WHO – International Society of Hypertension Guideline (1999 WHO-
ISH) [12], and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Eval-
uation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), defined hypertension as SBP greater than or
equal to 140 mm Hg or a DBP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg [13].
Considering the latest BP definition, a sizeable number of adults would be re-categorized as hyperten-
sive, who were previously classified as pre-hypertensive, or individuals with high normal blood pres-
sure. A study by Muntner et al. in US has indicated that the new prevalence of hypertension among
US population would be 14.7% higher compared with the previously recommended Joint National
Committee 7 (JNC7) cut-off points of 140/90 mm Hg [14]. Again, the new ACC/AHA guideline has
led scientist in other parts of the world to re-estimate and update the prevalence of hypertension
and related risks factors to give more meaning and significance to the revised guideline [15,16]. For
example, two studies in Bangladesh and Nepal investigated differences in hypertension prevalence
by comparing the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, and reported that about 22.3% of individ-
uals in Bangladesh, similar to Nepal’s findings would now be classified as having hypertension due
to the lowering of the blood pressure cut-offs [17]. These observed increases in hypertensive cases
as a result of the new guideline add to the reasons why more and more countries or regions in vari-
ous parts of the world need to revise their estimates for prudent planning and implementation of BP
management strategies.
Prevalence assists in disease burden estimation, whereas risk factors are helpful in identifying sub-
populations who may benefit from specific health interventions [17]. Previous studies that measured
BP with the earlier definition of 140/90 mm Hg found that hypertension prevalence could vary ac-
cording to age, sex, level of education and other sociodemographic characteristics [11,15].
Considering the huge number of pre-hypertensive individuals who would now be referred to as hy-
pertensives [11,17], the risk factors of this “new group” of hypertensives could also change, as previ-
ous studies found that “prehypertension” (as per previous guidelines) might vary according to back-
ground features of study respondents [18,19]. Modifying blood pressure level to define hypertension
could also change the associated factors that affect prevalence or likelihood of hypertension. Earlier
studies conducted in Ghana on BP prevalence and risk factors used WHO guidelines [12].
The JNC7 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines have not been used to estimate hypertension prevalence
among Ghanaian adults with the GDHS 2014 data. The use of these guidelines to estimate and com-
pare the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension for Ghana would be of particular interest and
significance because not only it is the first for the country, but could also help to identify patients
sooner, and probably lead to better management of hypertension in adults to minimize morbidities
and mortalities in the country. Hence, the current study was conducted to estimate the associated
socio-demographic risk factors and prevalence of hypertension among Ghanaian adults ≥18 years
using the JNC7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines, and to compare these risk factors
across the two guidelines using the GDHS data.

METHODS
Study setting
Ghana is a developing country centrally located on the West coast of Africa. It has a total land area of
238 537 km2. Ghana is a lowland country except for a range of highlands on the eastern border. Ghana
can be divided into three ecological zones: the low, sandy coastal plains, the middle and western parts,
and a northern savannah.
There are 10 administrative regions in Ghana: Western, Central, Greater Accra, Volta, Eastern, Ashanti,
Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper East, and Upper West. Ghana’s population was estimated at 27 million in
2014. The average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2010 was 2.5 percent.
The regions are subdivided into 216 districts to ensure equitable resource allocation and efficient, effec-
tive administration at the local level. The Ghanaian population is made up of several ethnic groups, with
the Akans constituting the largest group (48 percent), followed by the Mole-Dagbani (17 percent), Ewe
(14 percent), Ga-Dangme (7 percent), and others.
The 2014 GDHS is the sixth in a series of Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Ghana. The
main objective of the survey was to provide up-to-date information on various health indicators such as
fertility, childhood mortality levels and prevalence of diseases among adult populations to assist in health
care planning, policy making and to evaluate health interventions and strategies in Ghana [20].
Data source
Secondary analysis was performed using data from the 2014 GDHS, which is the latest and largest nation-
ally representative health survey publicly available in Ghana. It was implemented by the Ghana Statisti-
cal Service (GSS), the Ghana Health Service (GHS), and the National Public Health Reference Laboratory
(NPHRL) of the GHS [21]. These data have been weighted to cater for the different sample proportions.
The survey was conducted from early September to middle December, 2014 and included these structured
questionnaires: the Women’s Questionnaire, the Household Questionnaire, and the Men’s Questionnaire.
GDHS sample design and procedure
The details of the sampling procedure used in the GDHS have been previously published [19]. In short,
the GDHS was a nationally representative, cross-sectional household survey, which adopted a stratified,
two-staged probability sample design [19,20]. First, clusters (made up of enumeration areas (EAs)) of the
2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census (PHC) were delineated. This led to a total of 427 clusters
throughout the country (216 clusters in urban areas and 211 clusters in rural areas). The second stage
of the design involved household listing in all the selected EAs. A systematic sampling method was used
to select about 30 households from each cluster resulting in the selection of 12 831 households country-
wide. All men aged 15-59 and women aged 15-49 years who were either permanent residents of select-
ed households or visitors who stayed in the households the night before the survey were eligible to be
interviewed. In addition, blood pressure measurements were done for all the selected households for the
female survey, but for the male survey, it was taken for half of the households selected [20]. A 99% re-
sponse rate of all selected households was achieved. Considering eligible participants to be interviewed,
97% and 95% of women and men were interviewed, respectively [19].
Analytic sample and population
The GDHS sample design uses different parameters for indicators to estimate the final sample size. In
view of the above, we used recoded files of men and women (4388 and 9396), respectively. Specifically,
our study focused on adults (men and women) 18 years and above.
Study variables
Outcome variable
Hypertension was defined according to the two guidelines used in this study. First, the JNC 7 guideline
defines the condition as individuals who have an SBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or a DBP great-
er than or equal to 90 mm Hg or take any prescribed drugs to control blood pressure. Second, according
to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, individuals who have an SBP greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg or

a DBP greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg or take any prescribed drugs to control blood pressure. The
category of prehypertension was changed to elevated blood pressure in the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines
(Table S1 in the Online Supplementary Document).
Blood pressure measurement
The blood pressure of the survey participants was measured with the LIFE SOURCE UA-767 Plus blood
pressure monitor. It is a standardized device recommended by the WHO. Subjects sat quietly in a chair
during blood pressure measurement. Three consecutive measurements were taken for each individual in
a sitting position with an interval of 10 minutes or more between measurements. The measurements were
taken by trained field workers. The exclusion criteria included: nonresidents ie, those who did not spent
a night in a household during the census; individuals <18 years of age; residents who were absent during
the survey; and those whose BP was not measured thrice. All values of BP measurements were checked
and randomly cross-verified for consistency. In order to minimize bias that might be introduced as a re-
sult of making decision on blood pressure based on only one measurement, the average of the three re-
corded measurements of BP were calculated. Then the final blood pressure level was binary coded based
on both criteria (JNC 7 and 2017 ACC/AHA) to define hypertension.
Independent variables
We obtained information on the following socio-demographic variables guided by studies in Ghana and
other developing countries to determine the risk factors of hypertension [17,19-21].
Variables used are as follows: Individual level variables: sex (male, female); age (18-24 years, 25-34 years,
35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55 and above); marital status (never married, married, living with partner and
Widowed/Divorced/No Longer Living Together & Separated (WD/DV/S); place of residence (rural, urban).
Household level variables: region of residence (Western, Central, Greater Accra, Volta, Eastern, Ashanti,
Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper East, Upper West) and ethnicity (Akan, Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, Mole-Dagbani
and other ethnic groups). The proxy indicators of socio-economic status: level of education (no educa-
tion, primary, secondary, college or above); occupation (not working, professional/technical/clerical, sales,
agriculture, and Household and Domestic/Services/Skilled Manual/ Unskilled manual, (HH/DD/S) and
Wealth quintiles (poorest, poorer, middle, richer, richest). The wealth index was designed from house-
hold assets data using principal components analysis. These assets consisted of a television, bicycle, or
car, as well as dwelling characteristics such as a source of drinking water, sanitation facilities, and type of
flooring material. The other ethnic group’s category of the ethnicity variable was a pool of more than five
smaller groups (Guan, Grusi, Gruma, Mande and others) in Ghana. Table S1 in the Online Supplemen-
tary Document describes all study variables and their categories.
Statistical analysis
The demographic characteristics of the study participants were reported according to the presence of hyper-
tension (as per both JNC7 and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines), as well as the overall population. Since all in-
dependent variables were categorical, numbers and frequencies were used to summarize the data. The data
set was considered to report weighted frequencies because of the two stage stratified cluster sampling design
in DHS surveys. Identification of the significant associates of hypertension, as per both guidelines, was pri-
marily done using bivariate logistic regression. All explanatory variables were considered to be nested in a
cluster for multivariable analysis. Then, the significant variables (P < 0.05) were maintained for the multivari-
able logistic regression. Crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio were reported in the results. McNemmar’s
test was used to check up the difference in labelling a patient as having hypertension using the two guide-
lines. Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factor. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
as significant throughout the analysis. Stata 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for data
analysis. Processing of figures and tables was done using MS Excel 2013 (Microsoft Inc, Seattle, WA, USA).

Males compared with females had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension as per the 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline than the JNC7 guideline. Similar trends were observed in all the remaining risk factors
per both guidelines stratified by sex.
Risk factors of hypertension
In order to determine the risk factors of hypertension, both bivariate and multivariable regression analy-
ses were done for the two guidelines. At bivariate level, all variables were found to be significantly asso-
ciated with the presence of hypertension for both guidelines. Hence, they were incorporated in the mul-
tivariable analyses.
The multivariable logistic regression model using the JNC7 guideline showed that age was significantly
associated with hypertension, with the highest OR of 13.91 (95% CI = 9.24-20.95) for 55-64 year-group,
followed by an OR of 11.73 (95% CI = 8.68-15.84) for 45-54 year-group, 6.77 (95% CI = 5.08-9.02) for
35-44 year-group, and 2.82 (95% CI = 2.14-3.70) for 25-34 year-group. However, subjects’ level of ed-
ucation, marital status, region of residence, and the ethnicity of participants were insignificant per this
guideline.
The odds of being hypertensive was 1.50 times among males compared to females. (aOR = 1.50; 95%
CI = 1.30-1.73). Richer adults of the wealth index group were 1.40 times (aOR = 1.06-1.85) more likely
to have hypertension as compared to poorest adults. Urban residents were found to have a significantly
higher odds of BP (aOR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.08-1.50) than rural residents.
Being a professional or a technical manager, or a clerical staff was a determinant of hypertension
(aOR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.02-1.86).
With regards to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, age was significantly associated with hypertension, even
though the magnitude of associations of the age groups with hypertension were lesser compared to the
JNC7 guideline. (Table 2). Subjects in the following age groups: 25-34 (aOR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.77-2.37),
35-44 (aOR = 3.91; 95% CI = 3.33-4.59), 45-54 (aOR = 5 72; 95% CI = 4.78-6.85), and 55-64 (aOR = 6.42;
95% CI = 4.70-8.77) were associated with BP. Males were more likely to have hypertension, 1.39 (95%
CI = 1.26- 1.53). With regards to wealth quintile: middle, richer and richest adults were more likely to
get BP (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). Participants residing in urban areas, and the Widowed/Divorced/No Longer
Living Together & Separated had higher odds of getting hypertension, (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.05-1.32)
and (aOR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.06-1.52), respectively.
Further, other risk factors considered under the ACC/AHA guideline were; occupation- agriculture
(aOR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.68-0.96), Central (aOR = 0.82; 95% 0.69-0.98), Eastern (aOR = 0.80; 95% CI
0.66-0.96), Northern (aOR = 0.74; 95% 0.60-0.94) and Upper East (aOR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.94) re-
gions recorded significant inverse relationships with hypertension. No significant effects were noted in
ethnicity and the level of education (Table 2).
Differences in characteristics between males and females
The possible existence of difference in characteristics of the various risk factors across sex was investigat-
ed using χ2 test. The result showed that proportions of males across age categories (P < 0.001), level of
education (P < 0.001), marital status (P < 0.001), place of residence
(P = 0.013) and occupation (P < 0.001) were significantly different. However, an even distribution of males
and females was observed across the wealth quintile categories (P = 0.084), region (P = 0.561) and eth-
nicity (P = 0.328) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study noted that, the overall prevalence of hypertension were 11.48% and 30.43% for the JNC7
and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, respectively. Considering the risk factors with both guidelines, we did
not only show significant associations between age groups, urban residents and richer individuals, but
also demonstrated sex-related difference in the determinants of hypertension, specifically, males exhib-
ited higher BP levels compared to females. With regards to the individual guidelines, respondents in the
middle income and richest wealth quintile groups, those engaged in agriculture, the widowed/divorced/

no longer living together and separated as well as adults from Central, Eastern, Northern and Upper East
regions demonstrated positive associations with the ACC/AHA 2017, whereas only manual or clerical
workers were more likely to get hypertension according to the JNC7 guideline.
The proportion of Ghanaian adults’ population (18 years and above) classified as hypertensives signifi-
cantly increased from 11.48% (JNC7) to 30.43% (2017 ACC/AHA) guidelines. This finding indicates that

AHA guideline is substantially higher than the 13.0% prevalence rate of hypertension found by an
earlier study among adults in Ghana [21]. Similar increases in prevalence according to the new guide-
line have been observed in recent studies elsewhere. A comparable pattern was seen in a study of hy-
pertension prevalence among adults in US and China.
For the US study, adults’ population between the ages of 45 and 75 years classified as hypertensives
increased from 49.7% (JNC7) to 63.0% (2017 ACC/AHA) guidelines. Likewise among Chinese adults
of same age range identified as hypertensives increased from 38.0% to 55% based on same guidelines
[16]. Similar substantial increments in prevalence were again observed in Bangladesh and Nepal [17,18].
As a result, this latest guideline brings to the fore the need to provide more health care infrastructure
and logistics to manage the increased numbers of clients. In addition, new health screening strategies
could be used to pick up potential clients early for prompt management.
Ageing is an independent predictor of hypertension. The result of our study is consistent with other
Ghanaian and international studies [9,17-19,21-30]. The advanced age category of 55-64 years showed
the highest likelihood of hypertension according to both guidelines. Thus, our result further confirms
that ageing has a positive relationship with BP, and is a known risk factor of hypertension among the
study population. The reason could be physiological ie, increasing age comes with several structural
changes in arterial walls including increased responsiveness to sympathetic nervous system stimuli
and increased cellular oxidative stress leading to arterial and arteriolar stiffness [30]. With old age as
a predisposing factor of hypertension, the elderly is at a substantial risk for developing hypertension
and other CVDs with consequent increased in disease burden on the health care system. Therefore,
timely and regular interventions such as awareness creation to control and prevent hypertension with
special focus on older adults should be emphasized.
Although, some previous studies have suggested that females were more likely to get BP compared to
men [17,21,27,29], our study revealed that men were more likely to develop hypertension based on
the cut-off points of both guidelines. This finding strengthens the notion that sex is a significant risk
factor of BP. Other studies with the JNC7 and WHO algorithms’ have established similar findings in
other parts of the world [23,24,26,28,30,31]. Though, both men and women develop hypertension,
gender differences in the prevalence and severity of hypertension have been well established – where
men have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared with women of the same age until the sixth
decade of life. Again, the prevalence of hypertension for females in this study was lower than males
at the younger ages (below 45 years), but it exceeded men of older ages. The above observation cor-
roborates an earlier finding that estrogen hormone plays a protective role in women until menopause
[32,33]. Both experimental and clinical studies have revealed that estrogen exerts different cardiovas-
cular effects, such as sympatho-inhibition, vasorelaxation and subsequently decreasing aortic stiffness
through actions on the endothelium and smooth muscle cells [34], thus, all these physiological activ-
ities act as protective factors against hypertension. Not only do the differences between sex hormones
in both sexes contribute to this sexual dimorphism in BP, but the sex chromosomes also play a key role
[35]. This suggests that the sex differences among adults may be partly due to biological differences,
nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate psychosocial factors that may contribute to this
disparity. Most of the participants 52.3% had attained secondary school education, additionally, more
males than females had secondary education and above. Although, there was a significant difference
in educational level between males and females, there were no significant relationships between edu-
cation and hypertension per both guidelines, which is similar to a finding by an earlier study in Gha-
na [21]. The crude odds ratio of subjects with college or above education seen in this study could be
as a result of factors such as staying in urban areas.
Many educated persons in Ghana live in big towns and cities due to factors including job availability.
On the other hand, these results are unlike a finding in Bangladesh with both cut-offs where hyper-
tension showed significant relationship with higher education [17]. Whereas other studies found low
level of education to be associated with hypertension [23,27,29,30,36]. The relationship between health
and level of education could be complex, it has can be assumed that, the more educated a person is,
the more knowledge he or she may have on matters of health. The truthfulness of this assumption did
not reflect or otherwise in our study.
Several studies have reported an independent association between urban residence and hypertension
[17,19,21,22,24,25,28,37]. In the present study, similar to the JNC7, urban residence had significant
relationship with hypertension as per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. This could be due to the high

psychological stress urban residents are subjected to due to factors such as heavy life demands, and
traffic congestions experienced in cities [21], moreover, changes in lifestyle as a results of urbanization
could be a factor, meanwhile, these challenges are expected to increase with continues urbanization [4].
The effects of household wealth status on hypertension have been confirmed in this study according
to both guidelines. The risk of hypertension increases with increasing affluence according to 2017
ACC/AHA guideline. A previous study in Ghana revealed that an individual’s socioeconomic status
may affect his/her behaviors and life choices, which could render him/her prone to getting hyperten-
sion. Similar observations have been reported elsewhere [19,21,31]. Further, hypertension was found
to be more common among those who were widowed/divorced/no longer living together & separated
(WD/DV/S) according to only the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines.
The higher likelihood of hypertension among the WD/DV/S is similar to findings from previous studies
[19,21,23,38] even though the reasons for this results is quite unclear, it could probably be as a results of
inadequate income and inaccessibility to health care services due to low social support systems. Adults
living in the Central, Eastern, Northern and Upper East regions had lower risk of hypertension, this is
similar to an earlier finding [21]. The reasons for this finding is not clear, hence explorative studies are
warranted to assess the reasons for the less likelihood of getting hypertension among inhabitants in
these regions. Professional/technical, manual and clerical workers were independently associated with
hypertension according to the JNC7 guidelines. This is consistent with another study which showed
that higher efforts at work could be related to hypertension [39]. Therefore, workplace interventions
that decrease exhaustion and stress should the implemented to reduce employees’ chances to get BP.
Strengths and limitations
Our study used a nationally representative sample from all the administrative regions covering all the
rural and urban areas of Ghana. This geographically large and diverse coverage makes the survey gen-
eralizable for Ghana. This survey used validated research instruments that further increased the au-
thenticity of our results. The study had a high response rate. To our knowledge, this is the first survey
to estimate hypertension prevalence among Ghanaian adults with the GDHS 2014 data according to
the JNC7 cut off points and compared it with the risk factors as per the ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines.
The limitations of this study also warrant discussion. The GDHS was a cross-sectional study thus,
causal pathways underlying the reported associations cannot be ascertained, and again, this technique
might have resulted in some misclassification biases [17]. The skill level of some survey staff could
also lead to misclassification bias [19]. Some known risk factors for hypertension such as stress, obe-
sity, diabetes, physical activity, dietary habits, or dyslipidemia could not be investigated due to data
set limitations.
CONCLUSIONS
Early identification and treatment of people with hypertension is vital. Our study establishes more firm-
ly the importance of identified risk factors of BP from the JNC7 algorithms utilizing the new 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline definition. Overall, advancing age, urban residence, people with higher socioeconomic
status, male sex, widowed/divorced/no longer living together & separated, agricultural, professional/
technical/manual and clerical workers need special interventions to manage the disease. We recom-
mend similar studies in the future to follow up and describe trends in the risk factors; particularly,
modifiable factors which are most likely be on the increase. We believe that these results would assist
clinical care by determining the associations of these factors with hypertension in Ghana. Research
on effectiveness on interventions are needed, and strategies to minimize the burden of hypertension
risk factors should be replicated in Ghana if they have proven to be effective in similar settings. Our
results shows the need for health policy makers to review the current hypertension guideline use in
the country for better planning and implementation.

cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline, we determined the impact of this guideline on the
prevalence of hypertension and associated CVD risk.
Methods: Nineteen thousand, one hundred and fourteen participants aged at least 65 years from
the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study were grouped by baseline BP:
‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ (BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or on antihypertensive drugs); ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ (normotensive by pre-2017 guidelines; hypertensive by AHA/ACC-2017 guideline),
and ‘normotensive’ (BP <130 and <80 mmHg). For each group, we evaluated CVD risk factors,
predicted 10-year CVD risk using the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk
equation, and reported observed CVD event rates during a median 4.7–year follow-up.
Results: Overall, 74.4% (14 213/19 114) were ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’; an additional 12.3%
(2354/19 114) were ‘reclassified hypertensive’ by the AHA/ACC-2017 guideline. Of those
‘reclassified hypertensive’, the majority (94.5%) met criteria for antihypertensive treatment
although 29% had no other traditional CVD risk factors other than age. Further, a relatively lower
mean 10-year predicted CVD risk (18% versus 26%, P<0.001) and lower CVD rates (8.9 versus
12.1/1000 person-years, P=0.01) were observed in ‘reclassified hypertensive’ compared with
‘pre-2017 hypertensive’. Compared with ‘normotensive’, a hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)
for CVD events of 1.60 (1.26–2.02) for ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ and 1.26 (0.93–1.71) for
‘reclassified hypertensive’ was observed.
Conclusion: Applying current CVD risk calculators in the elderly ‘reclassified hypertensive’, as
a result of shifting the BP threshold lower, increases eligibility for antihypertensive treatment but
documented CVD rates remain lower than hypertensive patients defined by pre2017 BP
thresholds.

INTRODUCTION
Elevated blood pressure (BP) is one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular disease
(CVD). An estimated 1.39 billion (~31%) of the world’s adult population aged at least 20
years had hypertension in 2010 [1], and more than 90% of individuals who are free of
hypertension at 55 years of age will develop hypertension during their remaining lifespan
[2]. Despite availability of effective treatments, the management of hypertension in the
elderly population presents unique challenges [3,4].
Hypertension guidelines prior to 2017, as well as the recent 2018 European Society of
Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guideline, recommended BP
(systolic/diastolic) target levels less than 140/90 mmHg based on office BP measurements;
the exception being the Eight Joint National Commission (JNC-8) report, which
recommended target levels of less than 150/90 mmHg for those individuals 60 years and
older [5–7]. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/
ACC) 2017 guidelines for the management of high BP now recommend BP levels below
130/80 mmHg for all individuals, including older adults [8]. This recommendation follows
findings from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which demonstrated

improved cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk people with BP targeted to a SBP treatment
goal of 120 mmHg compared with a SBP goal of 140 mmHg [9].
We examined the prevalence of hypertension in an elderly cohort free of documented
evidence of CVD, who were enrolled from Australia and the United States (US) into a
primary prevention trial assessing aspirin’s ability to prolong healthy independent lifespan
[10]. In this analysis, we sought to determine to what extent the change in classification of
hypertension, by applying the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline, would increase the prevalence of
hypertension in the cohort. Further, we quantified the presence of additional CVD risk
factors in addition to hypertension, calculated predicted future CVD risk and observed CVD
events among these elderly cohort; and compared between individuals reclassified as
hypertensive patients by the new guideline and those deemed hypertensive by traditional
(pre-2017) hypertension guideline.
METHODS
Study population
We used baseline and follow-up data from participants enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing
Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study (NCT01038583). The ASPREE study design and
primary findings have been previously published [10–12]. In brief, the study recruited 19
114 participants (16 703 in Australia and 2411 in the United States) during 2010–2014, and
randomized participants in a double-blind manner to receive enteric-coated aspirin (100 mg
daily) or matched placebo, with a median of 4.7 years of follow-up. Two baseline visits were
conducted to determine study eligibility. Detailed information about inclusion and exclusion
criteria has been previously reported [10]; in brief, ASPREE participants at enrolment were
free of documented CVD or dementia, significant physical disability, or any illness expected
to limit their life expectancy to less than 5 years. Further, participants with SBP at least 180
mmHg and/or DBP at least 105 mmHg were excluded. In Australia, recruitment was mostly
conducted in the general (family) practice setting with the participant’s usual primary care
(family) physician. In the United States, recruitment was community-based through
academic and clinical trial centers. To achieve a goal of at least 50% minorities in the United
States, the ASPREE recruitment protocol was modified in 2011 and recruitment in the
United States was then restricted to minorities (e.g. African American, Hispanics) only, and
their age of inclusion lowered to 65 years. ASPREE had multiple Institutional Review Board
approvals in the United States and Australia.
Baseline measures
Participants were asked during baseline visits about their medical history and were assessed
for physical function, lifestyle, and other clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory data. In
addition, information about concomitant prescription medications was collected by review
with the participant and through their general practice records. BP for each participant was
measured three times on one occasion according to established guidelines by trained study
staff, and following standardized operating procedures, prior to randomization to aspirin or
placebo. The average of the three oscillometric BP measurements taken at least 1 min apart
was recorded as the BP for that participant’s visit.

Follow-up and cardiovascular events
Participants were followed for a median of 4.7 years until the aspirin intervention ceased.
CVD was a prespecified secondary endpoint, and consisted of fatal coronary heart disease,
nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure.
All events were adjudicated by an endpoint committee blinded to treatment allocation.
Hypertension definition and grouping of ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly study
participants
We defined hypertension in the ASPREE participants at baseline according to BP and use of
antihypertensives, and grouped them into one of three categories. Participants who had mean
SBP at least 140 mmHg and/or mean DBP at least 90 mmHg (regardless of whether they
were prescribed any antihypertensive), as well as those using any antihypertensive
medication (regardless of BP), at baseline were classified as having hypertension. We termed
this group ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ as this definition used the traditional (pre-2017) BP
threshold for classification of hypertension, and this group included both participants who
were receiving treatment at baseline before the new AHA/ACC 2017 guideline was
introduced, as well as treated participants with BP controlled (<140/90 mmHg). Next, we
defined a second group of participants as ‘reclassified hypertensive’ if they were not
hypertensive according to the pre-2017 definition above but did meet the BP thresholds set
in the recent AHA/ACC 2017 guideline. These individuals had mean SBP 130–139 mmHg
and/or DBP 80–89 mmHg and were not receiving any antihypertensive medication. Finally,
participants with SBP less than 130 mmHg and DBP less than 80 mmHg, and not receiving
any antihypertensives were classified as the ‘normotensive’, referent group.
Antihypertensive medications were classified according to the WHO Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System [i.e. antihypertensives (C02), diuretics
(C03), peripheral vasodilators (C04), beta-blocking agents (C07), calcium channel blockers
(C08) and agents acting on the renin–angiotensin system (C09)].
Statistical analyses
We used descriptive analysis (frequency/sample proportions or mean with standard
deviations) to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD risk factors among the
ASPREE participants. Student t-test, ANOVA or chi-square tests were used to compare the
distributions of baseline characteristics or risk factors in different participant subgroups (i.e.
pre-2017 hypertensive, reclassified hypertensive, normotensive). Further, we assessed the
distribution of risk factors and predicted risk for CVD events by participant subgroups. We
categorized the presence of other traditional CVD risk factors (excluding hypertension) into
‘none’, ‘one’, ‘two’ and ‘three or more’; counting the presence of diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, smoking, obesity and reduced renal function. We used the modified
Framingham risk score (FRS) [13] and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease
(ASCVD) risk score [14] at baseline to predict 10-year CVD risk for each participant. The
FRS equation incorporates participant age, sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, SBP, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive medication use and current
smoking status among those aged 74 or less years old. The ASCVD risk score includes
information on age, sex, ethnicity, total cholesterol, HDL, SBP, diabetes, current smoking

status and antihypertensive treatment for participants aged 79 years old or less. For
participants with age higher than the maximum age for a risk prediction model, we
substituted the maximum age of the respective model. We also conducted a restricted
analysis to assess and compare the 10-year predicted risk among participants aged 74 years
or less (for FRS) or 79 years or less (for ASCVD) by baseline hypertension status, as per the
risk equation models.
We assessed the occurrence of documented CVD events (i.e. rate per 1000 person-years)
during the follow-up period by participant groups (‘pre-2017’, ‘reclassified’ and
‘normotensive’). Cumulative incidences based on competing-risk regression models were
used to show event risk, which were stratified according to groups based on baseline
hypertension status among all ASPREE participants. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards
model was used to compare hazards between groups. This analysis was adjusted for key
potential confounders, such as age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence and randomized
treatment regimen (i.e. aspirin/placebo). Further, given the importance of treating BP to
prevent stroke in this age group, we repeated the above analysis for stroke outcomes.
Sensitivity analyses
To test the robustness of our results, we conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we
regrouped the ASPREE participants based on baseline BP level and whether they were
prescribed antihypertensive medication or would be recommended to receive
antihypertensive medication. This resulted in the following groups: pre-2017 hypertensive
on medication (irrespective of BP level), pre-2017 hypertensive not on medication,
‘reclassified hypertensive’ recommended for antihypertensive medication (which includes
participants with BP 130–139/80–89 mmHg and ASCVD risk score ≥10%); and participants
not requiring treatment with antihypertensive medication (which includes ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ not requiring treatment because of ASCVD predicted risk less than 10% and
‘normotensive’ participants). We assessed the ASCVD risk as well as CVD event rate in
these re-grouped participants and used a Cox proportional hazards model to compare
hazards between groups in relation to those ‘not requiring treatment with antihypertensive
medication’.
Next, we regrouped the participants using actual BP and on-treatment status. This resulted in
the following groups: BP at least 140/90 mmHg and prescribed antihypertensive; BP at least
140/90 mmHg and not prescribed antihypertensive; SBP130–39 mmHg/DBP 80–89 mmHg
and prescribed antihypertensive; SBP130–39 mmHg /DBP 80–89 mmHg and not prescribed
antihypertensive; SBP less than 130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg and prescribed
antihypertensive; and SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg and not prescribed
antihypertensive. We assessed the CVD event rate in these re-grouped participants and used
a Cox proportional hazards model to compare hazards between groups in relation to those
‘SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg and not prescribed antihypertensive’. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas, USA).

RESULTS
Blood pressure
Mean BP (SBP/DBP) at baseline for the cohort was 139 ± 16/77 ± 10mmHg (Australia: 140
± 16/77 ± 10mmHg, United States: 135 ± 17/77 ± 10mmHg). The distribution of SBP and
DBP by age and sex for Australia and United States showed increasing SBP (except in
United States men), but decreasing DBP with older age (Fig. 1). The mean SBP was higher
in Australian compared with United States participants in all age groups, irrespective of sex.
We did not observe any difference in mean DBP between countries by age–sex groups
except for a lower DBP in the United States male participants aged 85 years and older.
Hypertension prevalence and impact of American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association 2017 hypertension definition
Figure 2 summarizes the ASPREE participants’ hypertension status at baseline based on
baseline BP and antihypertensive status. Overall, 74.4% (95% CI: 73.7–75.0) of the study
participants had hypertension (United States: 70% and Australia: 75%) based on ‘Pre-2017’
thresholds. Applying the AHA/ACC 2017 hypertension guidelines identified an additional
2354 individuals as hypertensive (‘reclassified hypertensive’), increasing the overall
prevalence from 74.4 to 86.7% (95% CI: 86.2–87.2) with slight differences by country (US
83% and Australia 87%). Further, we observed an additional 2426 (~12% of ASPREE
participants) elderly hypertensive individuals, who were already prescribed
antihypertensives and had BP controlled based on pre-2017 hypertension guideline (i.e.
‘SBP 130–39 and DBP <90 mmHg’/’DBP 80–89 mmHg and SBP <140 mmHg’), but who
would no longer be controlled when applying the AHA/ACC 2017 guidelines. We observed
higher hypertension prevalence with older age in Australian participants and US women but
not for US men, and these patterns held for both hypertension definitions (Supplementary
Figure 1a and Figure 1b, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419). The prevalence of hypertension
remained consistently lower in the US participants compared with Australian, irrespective of
age and sex. The US minorities aged 65–70 years had relatively higher hypertension
prevalence than those aged 70–74 years according to both hypertension definitions
(Supplementary Figure 1b, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419).
Characteristics of the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ individuals
The characteristics of participants in the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’, ‘reclassified hypertensive’
and ‘normotensive’ groups are summarized in Table 1. Among ‘pre-2017 hypertensives’,
71% of participants (Australia 70% and United States 77%) were receiving antihypertensive
treatment. ‘Reclassified hypertensive’ participants were younger, with higher proportions
being men and reporting active consumption of alcohol, as well as having higher blood
lipids (except triglyceride), in relation to ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ group participants (Table
1). Further, ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants tended to have lower BMI and were less
likely to have diabetes (based on fasting blood glucose levels ≥7mmol/l), as well as lower
use of medication for comorbidities, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes and depression in
relation to ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ (Table 1). An additional comparison of baseline
characteristics was conducted between these groups of participants by excluding those who
were receiving antihypertensive (irrespective of BP) in the pre-2017 hypertensive group

(Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419). The results were similar to the
comparison between the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive (untreated)’ and the ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ group except there was no statistically significant difference in the presence of
comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia (Supplementary Table 1, http://
links.lww.com/HJH/B419). We observed few statistically significant differences in baseline
characteristics of those ‘reclassified hypertensive’ and ‘normotensive’: a higher proportion
of ‘reclassified hypertensives’ were men, and they had higher BMI, lower HDL, and higher
triglycerides (Table 1).
Presence of cardiovascular risk factors and predicted future risk
A lower prevalence of CVD risk factors other than hypertension was observed in the
‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants compared with ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ participants
(Table 1). We observed that 29% of the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants did not have
any other traditional CVD risk factors, compared with 20% of the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’
participants. Baseline predicted probability of having CVD over the next 10 years was
significantly higher in the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ group than the ‘reclassified hypertensive’
group based on both Framingham risk scores (mean predicted probability 25.5 versus
18.0%, P<0.001; Fig. 3a) and ASCVD risk scores (mean predicted probability 28.6 versus
20.5%, P< 0.001; Fig. 3b). On the basis of ASCVD predicted risk score of at least 10%,
among the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants, 94.5% would be recommended for
treatment with antihypertensives according to AHA/ACC 2017 guideline. A similar
difference in CVD risk prediction and also in the distribution of prevalence for other
traditional CVD risk factors were observed among ASPREE participants by baseline
hypertension status, when analyses were restricted to participants with age 74 years or less
(for FRS) or 79 years or less (for ASCVD) (Supplementary Table 2, http://
links.lww.com/HJH/B419).
Cardiovascular disease events during follow-up and its association with baseline
hypertension status
Over a median 4.7 years of follow-up, 922 CVD events (11.0 events per 1000 person-years)
occurred among the study participants. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of CVD events
and corresponding event rates by baseline hypertension status among ASPREE participants.
There was a significantly higher CVD event rate (per 1000 person-years) observed in the
‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ group compared with ‘reclassified hypertensive’ group participants
(12.1 versus 8.9 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI: 1.09–1.68, P=0.01) and
compared with the ‘normotensive’ group (12.1 versus 6.8 per 1000 person-years; hazard
ratio 1.79, 95% CI: 1.42–2.27, P<0.001). However, we did not observe a statistically
significant difference in the CVD event rates between ‘normotensive’ and ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ groups (6.8 versus 8.9 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.33, 95%
CI 0.98–1.79, P=0.07). Further, on exploration of the key characteristics of the ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ and ‘normotensive’ participants who experienced a CVD event, we did not
observe any significant differences between them except a difference in BP (Supplementary
Table 3, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419). The cumulative incidence of CVD events by
baseline hypertension status are shown in Fig. 4. The risk for CVD events for the ‘pre-2017
hypertensive’ (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.26–2.02, P<0.001) and ‘reclassified

hypertensive’ (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.93–1.71, P=0.14) group in relation to
‘normotensive’ group remained similar when adjusted for possible confounding factors (Fig.
4).
On restricting CVD events to stroke only, we did not observe a statistically significant
difference in stroke event rate between the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ and ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ groups; and also between ‘reclassified hypertensive’ and ‘normotensive’
groups (Table 2). On adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model, a higher risk of
stroke event (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02–2.27, P=0.04) was observed in the ‘pre-2017
hypertensive’ group compared with ‘normotensive’ group but no significant difference
(hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI: 0.84–2.29, P=0.20) was observed between ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ and ‘normotensive’ groups (Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis based on baseline blood pressure and antihypertensive medication
use or recommended for use
Among the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ participants, 70.8% were on antihypertensive
medication, whereas the rest were not on antihypertensive therapy despite meeting the BP
threshold for antihypertensive treatment according to the pre-2017 guidelines. Among those
‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants, 94.5% had a baseline predicted CVD risk of at least
10% based on ASCVD risk score, and would be recommended for antihypertensive
medication according to the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline. Overall, based on antihypertensive
use or recommendation for antihypertensive treatment, 52.6% of ASPREE participants were
‘pre-2017 hypertensive’ and on medication, 21.7% of participants were ‘pre-2017
hypertensive’ and not on medication, 11.7% of participants were ‘reclassified hypertensive’
and recommended for antihypertensive medication but not on medication, and 14% of
participants – either ‘reclassified hypertensive’ or ‘normotensive’ – were not recommended
for treatment. We observed a significantly lower predicted CVD risk in the ‘reclassified
hypertensive and recommended for medication’ group compared with the ‘pre-2017
hypertensive and on medication’ group (21.2 versus 29.3%, P<0.001) and with the ‘pre-2017
hypertensive and not on medication’ group (21.2 versus 26.8%, P<0.001; Supplementary
Table 4, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419). There was also a significantly lower CVD event
observed, compared with the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive and on medication’ group, in the
‘reclassified hypertensive and recommended for medication’ group (9.3 versus 12.5 per
1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60–0.94, P=0.01) and in the
‘pre-2017 hypertensive and not on medication’ group (11.0 versus 12.5 per 1000 person-
years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72–1.00, P=0.049). We did not observe a
statistically significant difference in CVD event between ‘reclassified hypertensive and
recommended for medication’ group compared with the ‘pre-2017 hypertensive and not on
medication’ group (9.3 versus 11.0 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95%
CI: 0.69–1.14, P=0.34). Further, no statistically significant difference in CVD event was
observed between the ‘reclassified hypertensive and recommended for medication’ group in
relation to the ‘participants not recommended for treatment with antihypertensive
medication’ group (i.e. ‘reclassified hypertensive not recommended for treatment’ or
‘normotensive’) (9.3 versus 6.6 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI:
0.93–1.71, P=0.13; Supplementary Table 5, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419).

Sensitivity analysis based on participants baseline BP and antihypertensive use status
revealed a statistically significant increased risk of CVD events among participants with ‘BP
at least 140/90 mmHg’ and/or ‘receiving any antihypertensive irrespective of BP’ groups
compared with those with ‘BP less than 130 and less than 80 mmHg and not receiving
antihypertensive’ group (Supplementary Figure 2, http://links.lww.com/HJH/B419). For
stroke-only events, we only observed an increased stroke risk among those with ‘BP at least
140/90 mmHg’ irrespective of antihypertensive treatment status compared with those with
‘BP less than 130 and less than 80 mmHg, and not receiving antihypertensive’. We did not
observe any difference in stroke risk between the participants with ‘SBP130–39/DBP 80–89
mmHg and receiving antihypertensive’ (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% CI: 0.90–2.41, P=0.12) and
‘SBP less than 130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg, and receiving antihypertensive’ (hazard
ratio 1.15, 95% CI: 0.68–1.94, P=0.61) in relation to those ‘BP less than 130 and less than
80 mmHg, and not receiving antihypertensive’ (Supplementary Figure 2, http://
links.lww.com/HJH/B419).
DISCUSSION
In this large elderly cohort aged 65 years and older without a history of CVD recruited from
Australia or the United States, hypertension was highly prevalent regardless of the BP
thresholds used to define it. There was a 12% increase in hypertension prevalence when
study participants’ BP was classified according to the AHA/ACC 2017 hypertension
guideline. Nearly 30% of these reclassified hypertensive participants (versus 20% among the
pre-2017 hypertensive participants) had no other CVD risk factors (i.e. diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, active smoking, obesity or reduced renal function) other than age.
Moreover, in the ASPREE cohort, the 10-year predicted CVD risk as well as observed CVD
events (over a median 4.7 years) were also significantly lower in the ‘reclassified
hypertensive’ participants than in those who were classified as hypertensive using pre-2017
guidelines. This suggests the reclassification of hypertension among the healthy elderly
using the combination of lower BP thresholds and CVD risk calculator is less sensitive in
identifying individuals with significantly higher CVD risk than those identified using
traditional BP thresholds (i.e. ≥140/90 mmHg).
Our findings on hypertension prevalence are consistent with other studies, which have
examined the potential impact of the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline on prevalence of
hypertension in the United States and Australian general populations [15,16]. A 14%
increase in hypertension prevalence was observed when the recent AHA/ACC 2017
hypertension guideline was applied to define hypertension compared with the pre-2017
guideline, among 9623 US participants in NHANES 2011–2014 who were at least 20 years
of age [15]. Adopting the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline in Australia is estimated to have an
even larger impact, potentially doubling the proportion of hypertensive population aged at
least 20 years, from 26 to 51%, based on 2014–2015 Australian health survey data [16].
In our study, 29% of the subset of reclassified hypertensive participants had no other known
CVD risk factors (compared with 20% for the pre-2017 hypertensive group) other than age,
and their estimated 10-year predicted CVD risk was also significantly lower compared with
pre-2017 hypertensive participants using both the Framingham risk equation (18 versus

25%) and the ASCVD risk equation (20 versus 27%). Furthermore, we observed fewer CVD
events in the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants in comparison with those classified as
having hypertension using the pre-2017 BP threshold; and no significant difference observed
in CVD and stroke-only events risk in the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants in
comparison with those classified as having ‘no hypertension’ at baseline. This finding could
reflect a healthy volunteer bias and/or because of fewer events between the two much
smaller groups in comparison with those in ‘pre-2017 hypertensive’.
Ninety-five percent of the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ participants identified in ASPREE with
‘SBP 130–139 mmHg and DBP less than 90 mmHg’ or ‘DBP 80–89 mmHg and SBP less
than 140 mmHg’ and ASCVD predicted risk at least 10% would be recommended for
treatment with antihypertensive medication. This is despite one-third of them having no
other CVD risk factors with the exception of being 70 years or older at baseline. Although
the ‘reclassified hypertensive’ group had higher predicted risk at baseline (i.e. an overall
intermediate risk) compared with the ‘normotensive’ group, similar CVD event rates were
observed in both groups. Considering age is an integrated part of the CVD risk prediction
equations along with absence of risk prediction tools for very elderly (e.g. ≥75 years), the
absolute baseline risk is higher in the elderly regardless of having any major comorbidity.
These findings highlight that current risk prediction models have limited utility for
contemporary elderly cohorts who have survived through an era of rapidly declining CVD
event rates, and suggests a need for further research to develop risk calculators, which will
better identify those elderly individuals most likely to derive benefits from preventive
treatment.
The risks and benefits of a lower threshold for antihypertensive therapy in older persons
need to be carefully considered, given the potential impact of initiation of antihypertensive
medications in millions of people moving into the eighth and ninth decade of life across the
globe. The potential benefits of this strategy were observed in this age group in the SPRINT
study, where intensive BP control significantly lowered the rate of CVD events and all-cause
mortality [17]. Recently, a meta-regression analysis demonstrated that for each 1 mmHg
lowering in mean SBP between the intensive BP control group and the standard BP control
group, there was 3% reduction in major adverse CVD events, including mortality [18].
Lower BP may also be related to reducing other aging disorders including cognitive decline
and dementia. Recent results from the SPRINT-MIND study suggest that despite failing to
prevent the onset of probable dementia over a 5-year period (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% CI
0.67–1.04), the secondary endpoint of development of mild cognitive impairment and
probably dementia was significantly reduced (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74–0.97) in the
tighter BP control group [19]. However, it should be noted that SPRINT participants were
enrolled on the basis of being at increased risk for CVD based on a history of clinical or
subclinical CVD, chronic kidney disease, 10-year Framingham Risk Score at least 15%, or
age at least 75 years. There is less evidence for a high degree of absolute benefit of intensive
BP control in those with low or intermediate risk of having CVD [20]. This is further
supported by a number of recent meta-analyses among the elderly (mean age 64 years),
which demonstrated that lowering SBP levels less than 140 mmHg was not associated with
any benefit in the setting of primary prevention but might benefit only those with a previous
history of heart disease [21,22]. Likewise, the risks associated with broadening the

classification of hypertension include those risks associated with poly-pharmacy, medication
complexity and pill burden [23]. Adherence to medication, potential for adverse and drug
interactions, drug costs and illness perception are all well known risks to individuals
receiving additional drug treatments for disease prevention [23].
Our study has important limitations to acknowledge. We used the conventional office BP
measurement at study entry (average of three readings obtained at a single examination,
taken 1 min apart on an oscillometric device). In clinical practice, this would normally be
followed by further visits and, if necessary, by home and/or ambulatory BP measurements to
confirm elevated BP readings. Furthermore, participants’ reported prescriptions for
antihypertensives was used to classify hypertensive status, and in some cases,
antihypertensives could have been used primarily for another indication (e.g. alpha blocker
for benign prostatic hyperplasia), or prescribed but not actually ingested. Both might have
caused an overestimation of our prevalence rates. Secondly, we used FRS and ASCVD
equations to estimate 10-year predicted probability of having CVD events among all
participants. Both of these equations were developed within younger cohorts, during a time
when rates of CVD among the general population were higher and CVD risk factors, such as
smoking were more common and use of statins was less; therefore, use of these risk scores
among the elderly are subject to significant limitations. However, on age-restricted
sensitivity analysis among participants aged 74 years or less (for FRS) and 79 years or less
(for ASCVD), our findings were unchanged. Lastly, we explored the observed CVD events
based on presence of hypertension defined from the study participants’ BP level at first
baseline visit. We did not adjust the CVD events rate for information, such as
antihypertensive drug adherence, duration of BP-lowering treatment or the introduction of
new BP-lowering treatment during the study, or the emergence of comorbidities, which
independently increase CVD risk, such as diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
Despite these limitations, our analysis from ASPREE highlights that hypertension is highly
prevalent among the healthy elderly and that the prevalence expectedly increases when
applying the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline. Further, because of higher predicted CVD risk
predominantly because of aging, nearly all of these newly classified elderly hypertensive
participants would be recommended for antihypertensive treatment. Yet our results suggest
that in those older adults free of CVD who are reclassified for antihypertensive treatment as
a result of shifting the BP threshold lower, the associated incremental absolute risk of CVD
is lower than predicted compared with those defined by the traditional hypertensive
threshold of at least 140/90 mmHg. Further, compared with ‘normotensives’, no significant
difference was observed in CVD events in the ‘reclassified hypertensives’ over a median 4-
year follow-up and also no significant difference observed in characteristics among those
who experienced CVD event. These findings highlight the limitations of using lower BP
thresholds and existing CVD risk calculators for primary prevention in a healthy older
cohort.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors acknowledge the dedicated and skilled staff in Australia and the United States for the conduct of the
trial. The authors also are most grateful to the ASPREE participants, who so willingly volunteered for this study,
and the general practitioners and medical clinics who supported the participants in the ASPREE study. Bayer AG
provided aspirin and matching placebo.
Funding: The work was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute at the
National Institutes of Health (grant number U01AG029824); the National Health and Medical Research Council of
Australia (grant numbers 334047, 1127060); Monash University (Australia); and the Victorian Cancer Agency
(Australia).
Conflicts of interest
Bayer AG supplied study drug (aspirin) and matching placebo also produce BP lowering medication (no link with
ASPREE’s participants) and had no other role in the trial. E.K.C. has received High Blood Pressure Research
Council Australia early career research transition grant to support current work. M.R.N. received travel and
consultancy support from Bayer to attend a meeting in Berlin. A.M.T. has received unrelated research support and
honoraria/travel expenses from Bayer. C.M.R. is supported on a NHMRC Principal Research Fellowship
(1136372). All other authors have no conflict of interest to declare in relation to this study.

Abstract
Objectives: Masked hypertension (MH) -- a blood pressure (BP) phenotype characterized by
a clinic BP in the normal range but elevated BP outside the office – is associated with early
hypertension-mediated organ damage. This study examined early target organ manifestations of
MH diagnosed by home (HBPM) and ambulatory (ABPM) BP monitoring.
Methods: Left ventricular (LV) structure and diastolic function measured by echocardiography,
urinary microalbumin, and coronary artery calcification were evaluated in 420 patients with
high clinic BP (systolic BP 120 – 150 mmHg or diastolic BP 80 - 95 mmHg). Evidence of
hypertension-mediated organ damage was compared in patients with sustained normotension, MH,
and sustained hypertension based on measurements by HBPM, daytime ABPM, and 24-hour
ABPM.
Results: The 420 participants averaged 48 (12) [mean (SD)] years of age; the average clinic BP
was 130 (13)/81 (8) mmHg. In subjects with MH diagnosed by HBPM, indexed LV mass, relative
wall thickness, and e’ and E/e’ (indices of LV relaxation), were generally intermediate between
values observed in normotensives and sustained hypertensives, and were significantly greater in
MH than normotensives. Similar trends were observed when MH was diagnosed by ABPM, but a
diagnosis of MH was not as reliably associated with LV remodeling or impaired LV relaxation in
comparison to normotensives. There were trends towards greater likelihoods of detectable urinary
microalbumin and coronary calcification in MH than in normotensives.
Conclusions: These results support previous studies demonstrating early hypertension-mediated
organ damage in patients with MH, and suggest that HBPM may be superior to ABPM in
identifying patients with MH who have early LV remodeling and diastolic LV dysfunction.

Introduction:
Masked hypertension (MH) is a distinct blood pressure (BP) phenotype characterized by a
clinic BP in the normal range but elevated BP outside the office. Recent studies suggest
that the prevalence of MH in adult patients is between 10 and 25% [1-5], and may be even
greater in patients with borderline elevated office BP. [6]
There is evidence that individuals with MH are at higher risk of adverse events than those
with sustained normotension (i.e., normal BP in and out of the office), and that the incidence
of cardiovascular events approaches that observed in patients with sustained hypertension
(i.e., high BP both in and out of the office). [1-4,7,8] This increased cardiovascular
morbidity may be a manifestation of hypertension-mediated organ damage in patients with
MH. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a greater left ventricular (LV) mass index
in subjects with MH compared to those with sustained normotension. [9-12] Others have
found that MH is characterized by impaired LV diastolic function [13], increased carotid
intima-media thickness [12], and microalbuminuria. [11,14] Many of these studies have
been performed in cohorts that included patients with treated hypertension. The methods
for diagnosing MH have varied; in most studies out-of-office BP has been determined by
either home BP monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), but few have
examined both.
In this analysis, we (1) compared measures of hypertension-mediated organ damage (LV
structure, LV diastolic function, urinary microalbumin, and coronary artery calcification) in
patients with normotension, MH, and sustained hypertension; and (2) examined whether MH
was more reliably associated with hypertension-mediated organ damage when diagnosed by
HBPM or ABPM.
Methods:
Subjects:
We recruited 420 adults from primary care clinics through a combination of passive and
active recruitment strategies. To be eligible, potential subjects had to be > 30 years of
age with no diagnosis of hypertension and on no BP-lowering drugs; and have a systolic
BP of 120-150 mmHg or diastolic BP of 80-95 mmHg on their most recent clinic visit.
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, clinical cardiovascular disease, diabetes, persistent
atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmia, dementia, and any condition that would
preclude wearing an ambulatory BP monitor. Potential participants were also excluded if
the average BP on the first visit to the research clinic was ≥160/100 mmHg or < 110/70
mmHg.

BP measurement:
All subjects underwent BP measurement in the research clinic, by HBPM, and by ABPM.
Details of BP measurement techniques have been described previously. [6]
Research clinic BP measurements were performed on 4 visits to the clinical research
center over the course of 10 days. On each visit, 3 seated measurements were acquired
after 5 minutes of rest using a validated oscillometric device (Welch Allen “Vital Signs”,
Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA). [15] The office BP was calculated as the average of the second
and third measurements from the research clinic visits.
HBPM measurements were acquired using a validated oscillometric home monitor (Omron
705CP). [16] Participants were carefully instructed in HBPM techniques, and were asked
to perform a series of measurements on 5 consecutive days. After a 5 minute rest, BP was
measured 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. For each home series, the first 2
days of measurements and the first measurement of each set of measurements was discarded.
The remaining 12 measurements were averaged and defined as the home BP. [17]
Twenty-four hour ABPM was performed using an Oscar 2 oscillometric monitor (Suntech
Medical, Morrisville, NC), a device that has been independently validated. [18,19] The
monitors were programmed to measure BP at 30 minute intervals during the day and at 1
hour intervals at night. A minimum of 14 awake readings and 6 sleep measurements was
required for an ABPM session to be considered adequate. [20] The mean values for awake
and 24-hour BPs were calculated.
For this analysis, a normal clinic BP was defined as < 140/90 mmHg, a normal home
BP was defined as < 135/85 mmHg, a normal awake ambulatory BP was defined as <
135/85 mmHg, and a normal 24-hour ambulatory BP was defined as < 130/80 mmHg. Using
HBPM, normotension was defined as normal office and normal home BPs; MH as normal
office but elevated home BPs; and sustained hypertension as elevated office and home BPs.
A similar classification scheme was employed using awake and 24-hour ambulatory BPs as
the referent out-of-office measurement techniques.
Assessment of hypertension-mediated organ damage:
Cardiac ultrasound studies were performed in the University of North Carolina research
echocardiography laboratory. Two-dimensional images of the LV, pulsed wave Doppler
transmitral flow velocity profiles, and tissue Doppler profiles of the septal mitral annular
motion were acquired and stored in DICOM format for subsequent quantification by a single
blinded observer (AH) using an off-line analysis system. All measurements were performed
on three cardiac cycles and averaged. LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), posterior wall
thickness (PWT), and interventricular septal thickness (IVST) were measured at end-diastole
just distal to the mitral valve tips. LV mass was estimated using a cube function model
with a correction factor, as described in the American Society of Echocardiography
Recommendations on the Use of Echocardiography in Adult Hypertension. [21] To adjust
for variations in heart size due to differences in body size, indexed LV mass was calculated
as LV mass/height2.7. [22] Relative wall thickness, an index of concentric remodeling of the
LV, was calculated as (PWT+IVST)/LVEDD. Measures of LV diastolic function included

peak early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (e’) and the ratio of the early (E) transmitral
Doppler flow velocity to e’ (E/e’ ratio). Lower values for e’ and greater values for E/e’
suggest impaired LV relaxation.
Coronary artery calcium was assessed by cardiac computed tomography (CT) in a subset
of subjects (n = 322) that consented to this procedure. Studies are performed on a 64-slice
dual source scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany). When heart rate
and scan time could be minimized the prospectively gated sequential scanning mode was
utilized in order to reduce radiation exposure, otherwise spiral acquisitions were performed.
All studies were read by a single cardiologist with training and expertise in cardiac CT (LK)
who was blinded to clinical and BP data. All lesions with a detection threshold of > 130
HU were identified. Images were scored for the presence or absence of coronary calcium,
and if present the coronary artery calcium load was computed using the method described by
Agatston, et al. [23]
Urinary albumin (using an immunoturbidometric assay) and creatinine (by a kinetic assay)
were measured on a single morning spot urine specimen. The lower limit of detection of
albumin was 0.6 mg/dl. Values for albumin were categorized as detectable or not, and
microalbuminuria was defined as > 30 mg albumin/g creatinine.
Demographic and anthropomorphic data:
Demographic data were collected by self-administered questionnaire. Height and weight
were measured at the first clinic visit for calculation of body mass index (BMI).
Study approval:
This study was conducted with the understanding and the consent of each participant, and
was approved by the Office of Human Research Ethics at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Analyses:
Anthropomorphic and demographic characteristics of the study cohort were calculated as
mean ± standard deviation or median (25th and 75th percentile), or number (%).
For each method of measuring out-of-office BP, mean (SD) or median (range) values of
measures of target organ damage were calculated for patients with true normotension,
masked hypertension, and sustained hypertension. Differences between values for masked
hypertension and normotension, and sustained hypertension and normotension, were
analyzed by two sample t-tests if the outcome was continuous and normally distributed, and
by Mann-Whitney tests if the outcome was continuous but non-normally distributed. Chi-
squared tests were used if the outcome was categorical. Differences between the subjects in
the 3 blood pressure categories were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusted
for age, race, gender, and body mass index.

Results:
Characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. The mean age was [mean
(SD)] 48 (12) years; most were between 30 and 44 years of age (43%) or between 45 and
64 years of age (46%). Slightly over half were female, and 21% were black. Most subjects
were overweight (34%) or obese (38%). The average clinic BP was 130 (13)/81 (8) mmHg.
Home BP was slightly lower, and both daytime and 24-hour ambulatory BP’s were higher,
than office BP.
The percentages of subjects diagnosed with each BP phenotype by the 3 methods of out-of-
clinic BP measurements are shown in Table 2. The numbers of subjects diagnosed with
MH were greater using either measure of ABPM than by using HBPM. The relationships
between the participants with MH diagnosed by the 3 methods are illustrated in the Figure.
Those with MH by HBPM, for the most part, represented a subset of those diagnosed by
ABPM; only 3 of those with MH by HBPM did not have this diagnosis confirmed by
24-hour ABPM, and only 2 did not have MH by awake ABPM. Most (175 of 180) subjects
with MH by awake ABPM had this BP phenotype by 24-hour ABPM; an additional 28
subjects had MH by 24-hour ABPM but not awake ABPM.
Measures of hypertension-mediated organ disease for subjects with normotension, MH,
and sustained hypertension as determined by HBPM are shown in Table 3. Indexed LV
mass and relative wall thickness were greater in subjects with MH than in normotensives.
Similarly, mean values for e’ and E/e’ suggested impaired LV relaxation in MH compared
to normotensives. Values for these indices of LV structure and diastolic function were
generally intermediate between values observed in patients with normotension and sustained
hypertension. Analogous data for BP phenotypes diagnosed by awake and 24-hour ABPM
are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. As observed when MH was defined using HBPM,
values for LV mass index, relative wall thickness, e’, and E/e’ were generally between values
for normotensives and sustained hypertensives. However, a diagnosis of MH was not as
reliably associated with ventricular remodeling or impaired LV relaxation in comparison to
normotensives.
As shown in Tables 3-5, few subjects had microalbuminuria (i.e., albumin/creatinine ratio >
30 mg/g). However, approximately 25-30% of those with MH had detectable albuminuria,
greater than the 15-20% of those with sustained normotension and less than the 35-45%
of those with sustained hypertension. Regardless of the method for diagnosing MH, the
difference between MH and normotensives did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly,
coronary calcium was observed in a minority of the subset of subjects who underwent CT
scanning, and there was a nonsignificant trend toward a higher prevalence in MH than in
normotensives.
Discussion:
In this cohort, compared to participants with sustained normotension, those with MH had
evidence of greater hypertension-mediated organ manifestations, including increased LV
mass and relative wall thickness and impaired LV relaxation, and a nonsignificant trend

toward a greater prevalence of detectable urinary albumin and coronary artery calcium. The
extent of target organ damage was less than that seen in those with sustained hypertension.
MH was more reliably associated with early cardiac manifestations of high BP when
diagnosed by HBPM than by ABPM.
A number of studies have demonstrated increased left ventricular mass in patients with MH
compared to those with normal BP’s outside the clinic. [9-12] Most of these prior analyses
have utilized ABPM to define BP phenotypes. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of
12 studies, Cuspidi, et al, reported that left ventricular mass index showed a progressive
increase from normotensive to MH to sustained hypertension subjects. [9] There is a paucity
of data, however, describing the cardiac consequences of MH defined by HBPM. Hanninen,
et al, examined end-organ manifestations of MH as defined by HBPM and ABPM in 261
men and women representative of the general population of Turku, Finland, some of whom
were prescribed anti-hypertensive medications. As in our study, individuals with normal
office BP but elevated home BP tended to have greater indexed LV mass than those with
normal BPs in both settings (p = 0.06), while mean LV mass index values were similar in
sustained normotensives and those with MH defined only by ABPM. [11] Our data are also
consistent with findings from the Improving Detection of Hypertension study. In a cohort of
408 men and women not on treatment with BP-lowering medications, ambulatory systolic
BP was higher than either home or office BP. LV mass index by echocardiography was more
closely correlated with home systolic BP than with systolic BP measured either by ABPM or
in the office. [24] Among participants with clinic BP < 140/90 mmHg, LV mass index was
greater in those with MH by both home and ambulatory monitoring than in those with MH
diagnosed by only one method or in those with sustained normotension. [25]
Impaired LV relaxation and elevated left atrial pressure are common findings in patients
with hypertension and may ultimately lead to the syndrome of heart failure. [26] Evidence
of early diastolic LV dysfunction can be detected in patients with high BP even before
the development of LV hypertrophy [27], and MH may predict the future development of
diastolic LV dysfunction. [28] We assessed characteristics of LV filling by pulsed wave
and tissue Doppler echocardiography. The mitral annulus early diastolic velocity derived
by tissue Doppler imaging (e’) and the ratio of early LV filling velocity E to e’ (E/e’)
are reproducible indices of LV relaxation. As previously described by Oe, et al, [13] in
the Masked Hypertension study, there was a progressive decrease in e’ and increase in
E/e’, suggesting worsening left ventricular diastolic function, from normotension to MH to
sustained hypertension. In our cohort, HBPM was more effective than ABPM in identifying
MH associated with impaired LV relaxation.
Microalbuminuria, defined as urinary albumin > 30 mg/g creatinine, is an important risk
factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with or without diabetes or hypertension.
[29-31] Even lower levels of albumin excretion within the normal range may be associated
with cardiovascular risk. [32-34] The prevalence of microalbuminuria was low in our cohort.
Detectable levels of albumin, however, tended to be more common in subjects with MH
than in normotensives, and less common than in sustained hypertensives. Similarly, although
the majority of our young, relatively healthy subjects who underwent CT scanning had
no detectable coronary calcification, there was a trend toward a greater prevalence of

coronary calcium in those with MH than in normotensives. Data from a large cohort of
asymptomatic patients without known coronary heart disease demonstrate that hypertension
is associated with coronary calcification, and that calcification is associated with a higher
risk of cardiovascular events in individuals with high blood pressure. [35] We are not aware
of other studies that have examined the relationship between MH and coronary calcium.
In our study cohort, average values for awake and 24-hour ABPM were higher than for
clinic BP. Clinic BP was measured with meticulous technique, with values acquired after
5 minutes of rest and averaged over multiple visits, and many of our subjects who had
modestly elevated BP’s in primary care offices had normal research clinic pressures. Since
ambulatory BP was, on average, higher than clinic BP, the prevalence of MH as defined by
ABPM was high. Home BP’s tended to be lower than clinic BP’s, however, and thus more
subjects were classified as having sustained normotension – and fewer had MH – when the
BP phenotype was determined by home monitoring. Similar findings have been described in
other cohorts. [24,36] Ambulatory BP tends to exceed clinic BP in young and middle-aged
individuals, as enrolled in this study. [37,38] In contrast, home BP is usually less than clinic
BP across age ranges. [37] The difference between the prevalences of MH by ambulatory
and home monitoring was greater in our cohort than in some previous studies, perhaps due
to differences in subject characteristics, monitoring protocols, and BP measurement devices.
MH is associated with a risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality that is twice that seen
in normotensive individuals, and similar to the risk observed in sustained hypertensives.
[39,40] This observation led to the recommendation in recent guideline statements that
patients with elevated BP be screened for MH, and that treatment with antihypertensive
medications be considered if MH is documented. [41,42] ABPM has been favored as the
optimal method for measuring BP outside the clinic -- and therefore for diagnosing MH
-- because of the abundance of data supporting its value in predicting adverse outcomes,
independent of office BP. [43] Unfortunately, however, ABPM is not widely available and
is associated with some expense. HBPM is an attractive alternative because it, like ABPM,
provides incremental value to office measurements in predicting CVD events [43], and
because many patients already have home monitoring devices and can acquire out of office
data at minimal cost. [44] Effective utilization of this method requires the use of accurate,
well-validated monitors; education and counselling of patients so that measurements are
made with appropriate technique; accurate recording of values; and reliable transmission of
data to health care providers. Our data suggest that HBPM may be the preferred method for
diagnosing MH, more reliably identifying patients with early left ventricular remodeling and
impaired left ventricular relaxation.
Our study has important strengths. It examined a cohort of patients -- untreated individuals
with clinic systolic BPs within 20 mmHg of the partition values generally accepted for
initiating medical therapy -- in whom out-of-office BP is important in refining clinical
decision-making and in whom MH is relatively common. Although previous studies have
examined the relationship of hypertension-mediated organ damage to MH defined on the
basis of either home or ambulatory monitoring, few have compared results using these two
forms of out-of-office BP measurements. Several limitations also merit acknowledgement.
Our ABPM measurement protocol was designed to provide adequate data while minimizing

subject burden; the measurement frequency of 30-minute intervals during the day and 60-
minute intervals at night is in the range endorsed by some international guidelines [41,45],
although more frequent measurement is recommended by others. [46] We measured urinary
albumin on a single visit, rather than averaging 3 values. Since our study cohort consisted
primarily of untreated middle-aged patients, the findings may not be generalizable to other
groups. Our study cohort was relatively small, limiting the statistical power to fully examine
some relationships.
In summary, in a cohort of untreated patients with high normal or modestly elevated
BP’s, MH was diagnosed more often using ABPM than by using HBPM. In patients with
MH, measures of hypertension-mediated organ damage tended to be intermediate between
those who are normotensive and those with sustained hypertension. However, MH was
more reliably associated with left ventricular remodeling and impaired LV relaxation when
diagnosed by HBPM. These results suggest that HBPM may be superior to ABPM in
identifying MH patients who have early evidence of target organ damage and who may
warrant more aggressive BP lowering therapy.

Study design—Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of patients referred for high blood
pressure (BP) and diagnosed with white coat hypertension by ABPM who had follow-up ABPM
0.5-4.6 years later at 11 centers in the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium. We classified
ABPM phenotype using the American Heart Association guidelines. At baseline, we classified
those with hypertensive BP in the clinic as “stable white coat hypertension,” and those with
normal BP as “intermittent white coat hypertension.” We used multivariable generalized linear
mixed effect models to estimate the association of baseline characteristics with abnormal ABPM
phenotype progression.
Results—Eighty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria (median age, 13.9 years; 78% male).
Median interval time between ABPM measurements was 14 months. On follow-up ABPM, 61%
progressed to an abnormal ABPM phenotype (23% ambulatory hypertension, 38% ambulatory
prehypertension). Individuals age 12-17 years and those with stable white coat hypertension
had greater proportions progressing to either prehypertension or ambulatory hypertension. In the
multivariable models, baseline wake systolic BP index ≥0.9 was significantly associated with
higher odds of progressing to ambulatory hypertension (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.02-9.23).
Conclusions—The majority of the patients with white coat hypertension progressed to an
abnormal ABPM phenotype. This study supports the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics
Clinical Practice Guideline’s recommendation for follow-up of ABPM in patients with white coat
hypertension.
White coat hypertension is defined by the finding of hypertensive clinic blood pressure
(BP) but normal BP outside of clinical settings. In pediatric hypertension specialty clinics,
white coat hypertension is most often diagnosed when patients referred for evaluation
of high clinic BP are found to have a normal phenotype on ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM). The prevalence of white coat hypertension has been reported to be as
high as 52% among referred patients.1,2 The 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical
Practice Guideline recommends using ABPM to evaluate patients suspected of having white
coat hypertension.3 From a survey of pediatric nephrologists in North America, 94% of
respondents regularly use ABPM for this purpose.4
However, few data exist on outcomes of youth with white coat hypertension, and there are
no evidence-based practice guidelines addressing follow-up for children and adolescents
with white coat hypertension. The European Societies of Cardiology and Hypertension,
the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology suggest periodic
follow-up with home BP measurements and ABPM for white coat hypertension in adults,5,6
and the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline suggests follow-up
ABPM in 1-2 years.3 In a retrospective longitudinal study assessing ABPM stability in
124 otherwise healthy children and adolescents, we found that 12 out of 24 subjects who
initially had normal ABPM progressed to either prehypertension or ambulatory hypertension
on follow-up ABPM.7 Our objectives were to determine whether youth with white coat
hypertension remain normotensive on repeat ABPM, and if not, to identify baseline clinical
indicators associated with change in ABPM phenotype. We hypothesized based on our
previous work that many of those with white coat hypertension would progress to an
abnormal phenotype.

Methods
We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of patients at 11 centers in
the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium who were diagnosed with white coat
hypertension by initial ABPM between January 2007 and September 2019 and had a
follow-up ABPM at least 6 months later and no more than 5 years later. All patients were
under 18 years of age at the time of the initial ABPM study. For patients who were <13
years old at the time of the initial ABPM, the upper limit of follow-up ABPM for inclusion
was reduced to within 2 years because of the rapid growth and increase in BP expected
in preadolescents.8 Exclusion criteria included known kidney disease or other causes of
secondary hypertension, any history of malignancy, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, and
treatment with antihypertensive medication at the time of either ABPM. The number of
patients included per site is reported in Table I (available at www.jpeds.com). Indication
for the initial ABPM was evaluation of high BP in the referring providers’ clinics and/or
in the pediatric nephrology clinic. Patients receiving treatment with stimulant medications
for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were included in the study if their
medication doses remained stable during the study period; those on clonidine or guanfacine
were excluded.
Oscillometric devices were used for all ABPM studies (models 90207, 90217, and
90227; Spacelabs Healthcare). ABPM recordings were classified according to the approach
recommended in the pediatric American Heart Association statement on interpretation of
ABPM.9 For patients 17 years of age and younger, ABPM studies were classified as
normal and consistent with white coat hypertension if the mean wake and sleep systolic
and diastolic BP were below the 95th percentiles for sex and height and BP loads were all
<25%. Prehypertension was defined as mean wake and sleep systolic and diastolic BP below
the 95th percentiles for sex and height and BP loads ≥25%. For patients 18 years of age
and older, the wake hypertension threshold was set at 135/85 mm Hg and sleep threshold
was set at 120/70 mm Hg.10 For descriptive purposes, nocturnal BP dipping was defined as
normal if ≥10%, blunted if 0 to <10%, and reversed if mean sleep BP exceeded mean wake
BP.9 The nephrologist interpreting the ABPM determined the adequacy of each recording.
To facilitate comparisons between patients across the pediatric age range, BP indices were
calculated by dividing the mean wake and sleep systolic and diastolic BP readings by
appropriate 95th percentile values, wherein BP index ≥1.0 was consistent with hypertension.
Variables abstracted from the electronic health record included clinic BP measurements
(auscultatory and/or oscillometric) at the initial and follow-up pediatric nephrology clinic
visits as well as age, sex, height, height percentile for age and sex, body mass index (BMI),
BMI z score for age and sex, history of obstructive sleep apnea, ADHD diagnosis and
names and doses of ADHD medications, interval time between ABPM, and family history
of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Clinic BP index was defined similarly as
ABPM BP index (ie, BP index of clinic BP at the 95th percentile = 1.0). The 2004 Fourth
Report normative data were used for all patients due to the timing of patient assessments
and data collection.11 Oscillometric clinic BP was used to calculate clinic BP index if
no auscultatory measurement was entered. We did not obtain data on clinic BP values
or the type of measurement (auscultatory vs oscillometric) from referring providers. Once

local institutional review boards approved this study, data were collected manually by
each center’s investigators and submitted to the coordinating institution (Seattle Children’s
Hospital, University of Washington). Data were stored securely in a REDCap database12
with study unique identification numbers and no patient identifiers.
Based on clinic BP measured at the initial pediatric nephrology visit, we divided the cohort
into 2 groups, “stable white coat hypertension” and “intermittent white coat hypertension.”13
The stable white coat hypertension group was defined as those patients referred and
confirmed to have pediatric nephrology clinic BP in the hypertension range (clinic BP index
≥1.0) during their initial visit. The intermittent white coat hypertension group was defined as
those referred, but pediatric nephrology clinic BP index was <1.0.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized by their initial pediatric
nephrology clinic presentation, by white coat hypertension status (stable vs intermittent),
and by follow-up ABPM phenotypes. Continuous variables were summarized using median
with IQR. Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages. We
dichotomized the age groups: <12 years old vs 12-17 years old because of an observation
that rise in BP differs during puberty than in early life,8 BP during the adolescent years
tend to track stronger into adulthood,14 and to be consistent with our previous longitudinal
ABPM study.7 We classified subjects with a BMI z score >1.64 as obese. Comparisons
between groups were performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests
for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Histograms
were examined to select ABPM systolic and diastolic BP index cut points of interest.
Previously described cut points were also considered.7 Spearman correlation coefficients
were calculated across baseline ABPM systolic and diastolic BP index variables. We
used generalized linear mixed effect models to explore the associations between baseline
characteristics and progression to ambulatory hypertension (model A) or a combination of
either prehypertension or ambulatory hypertension (model B) at follow-up ABPM, with a
random intercept term for center in each model. In each model, we included the prespecified
baseline covariates baseline age <12, BMI z score, and baseline white coat hypertension
group, along with time between baseline and follow-up ABPM. ABPM systolic and diastolic
BP index variables were added to the model based on a univariable regression P value of
<.15. In the case of 2 or more highly correlated BP variables being significant in univariable
analysis, the more statistically significant variable was chosen. A 2-sided P value of <.05
was considered statistically significant, and all analyses were performed with R v 3.6.2.
Results
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
A total of 89 patients met the inclusion criteria. Table II summarizes the baseline
characteristics of the cohort. The median age at the time of initial ABPM was 13.9
years, with 16 patients <12 years of age and 73 patients age 12-17 years. The cohort
was predominantly male (78%). Overall, the median interval time between ABPM was 14
months (IQR: 12-22 months); 18 months (IQR: 12-24 months) for the <12-year-old group,

and 13 months (IQR: 12-19 months) for the 12- to 17-year-old group. The difference in the
interval time between these 2 age groups was not statistically significant (P = .23, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test). For both auscultatory and oscillometric clinic BP, median systolic BP indices
exceeded 1.0 and median diastolic BP indices were below 1.0. Descriptive statistics of the
initial ABPM studies are summarized in Table II.
Stable White Coat Hypertension vs Intermittent White Coat Hypertension
At the baseline pediatric nephrology clinic visit, 80% of patients met the case definition of
stable white coat hypertension, and 20% met the intermittent white coat hypertension case
definition. Table III summarizes baseline characteristics and ABPM data based on white
coat hypertension category. There were no statistically significant differences in patient
characteristics including age, sex, BMI z score, obesity prevalence, and any of the ABPM
variables.
Follow-Up ABPM
Most patients (61%) progressed to an abnormal ABPM phenotype. Follow-up ABPM
in 20 patients (23%) demonstrated ambulatory hypertension and in 34 patients (38%)
showed prehypertension. Thirty-five patients (39%) had normal follow-up ABPM. Table IV
summarizes the baseline patient characteristics grouped by follow-up ABPM phenotypes. A
higher percentage of patients age 12-17 years and those with stable white coat hypertension
at the time of initial ABPM were found among those who progressed to prehypertension
or ambulatory hypertension at follow-up (overall Fisher exact test P values of .04 and .03,
respectively). Baseline BMI z score and obesity were not associated with progression to an
abnormal follow-up ABPM phenotype.
Table IV also provides a breakdown of the temporality of the ABPM abnormalities. Of
the 20 patients who developed ambulatory hypertension phenotype, 65% demonstrated
sleep-only hypertension, 10% had wake-only hypertension, and 25% had both wake and
sleep hypertension. Of the 34 patients who developed prehypertension on follow-up ABPM,
41% had sleep-only prehypertension, 44% had wake-only prehypertension, and 15% had
both wake and sleep prehypertension.
In multivariable analysis (Table V), wake systolic BP index ≥0.9 on baseline ABPM was
significantly associated with higher odds of progressing to ambulatory hypertension (OR
3.07, 95% CI 1.02-9.23, model A). When combining prehypertension with ambulatory
hypertension, wake systolic BP index ≥0.9 on baseline ABPM was again associated with
higher odds of progression (OR 4.37, 95% CI 1.35-14.15, model B). In addition, baseline
stable white coat hypertension was associated with higher odds of progressing to either
prehypertension or ambulatory hypertension (OR 6.67, 95% CI 1.67-25.00).
Discussion
In this longitudinal follow-up study of youth with white coat hypertension who had a repeat
ABPM at least 6 months later, we found that most patients progressed to an abnormal
ABPM phenotype, including 23% progressing to ambulatory hypertension after a median
follow-up time of 14 months. Of note, isolated sleep-hypertension, a subtype of masked

hypertension, was the most prevalent type of ambulatory hypertension found on follow-up
ABPM. Patient characteristics at the initial pediatric nephrology evaluation that may be
associated with risk for progression to an abnormal ABPM phenotype include age ≥12
years, stable white coat hypertension as determined by pediatric nephrology clinic BP, and
wake systolic BP index ≥0.9. These data suggest that in children and adolescents with
an initial diagnosis of white coat hypertension, follow-up ABPM is indicated. In addition,
these data support the importance of follow-up ABPM given the high frequency of isolated
sleep-hypertension observed.
Our study also demonstrated that neither baseline BMI nor obesity was predictive of
abnormal follow-up ABPM, and we found this observation surprising. We believe that
the sample size of our study may have been too small to demonstrate any association of
obesity with progression to an abnormal ABPM phenotype. In addition, the relatively short
time interval between ABPM studies and the wide participant age range, which spanned all
pubertal stages, may have further contributed to the failure to demonstrate an independent
effect of obesity on ABPM phenotype progression in our cohort.
Studies in adults demonstrate that individuals with white coat hypertension are at increased
risk for progression to sustained hypertension.15,16 However, the relevance of these findings
for children is not certain considering that most participants in these studies were middle
aged or older and thus at higher risk for incident hypertension. Longitudinal data on the
risk of progression in children and adolescents with white coat hypertension are scant. In
accordance with our findings, a small study from Sweden with a longer follow-up time
of 9.3 years demonstrated that in 30 otherwise healthy school-age children with white
coat hypertension, 7 subjects (23%) progressed to sustained hypertension.17 Our findings,
indicating that progression to ambulatory hypertension may occur in some patients over
a shorter time frame, demonstrate the need for longitudinal follow-up with serial ABPM,
and confirm the recommendation in the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice
Guideline for follow-up ABPM 1-2 years following a diagnosis of white coat hypertension.3
Meta-analyses of studies conducted in adults have demonstrated that white coat
hypertension conveys a cardiovascular risk that is intermediate between normotension
and sustained hypertension. Adults with white coat hypertension have slightly higher
rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,18 higher left ventricular mass index,19
and greater common carotid artery intimal-media thickness.20 Evidence for target organ
changes in children with white coat hypertension is mixed. However, even though left
ventricular hypertrophy prevalence is not increased in white coat hypertension, several
studies have shown that left ventricular mass index in children with white coat hypertension
is intermediate between that of children with normal BP and those with hypertension.2,21-24
Similarly, children with white coat hypertension have greater carotid artery intimal-media
thickness compared with children with normal BP,24,25 and youth with white coat
hypertension may have endothelial dysfunction similar to that observed in children with
hypertension.26 The Swedish white coat hypertension longitudinal study discussed above
importantly compared the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid-femoral artery
pulse wave velocity, and carotid intimal-media thickness at the time of follow-up between
those who progressed to ambulatory hypertension and those who continued to have normal

ABPM. Although still within the normal range, those who progressed to ambulatory
hypertension had significantly higher pulse wave velocity and carotid intimal-media
thickness than the normotensive group, suggesting early-stage target organ changes.17
We also found a possible association between stable white coat hypertension at the initial
pediatric nephrology clinic visit with progression to abnormal follow-up ABPM phenotype.
Similarly, an adult 16-year follow-up study demonstrated that stable white coat hypertension
was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality when
compared with normotensive controls and intermittent white coat hypertension was not.13
Although few of the patients in our study had normal clinic BP at their initial pediatric
nephrology clinic visit (20%), our data suggest these individuals may be at less risk for
progression in this limited time frame.
Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, potential for selection bias,
small sample size, and imperfect ABPM reproducibility. First, given the high frequency
of white coat hypertension reported in the literature, it seems likely that many children
from each center did not return for follow-up evaluation and ABPM. Also, providers within
the participating centers may conduct follow-up differently,4 thus, limiting the number of
patients undergoing follow-up ABPM. Therefore, there is a high likelihood of selection bias.
As mentioned in the methods section, we also set an upper limit of interval time between
ABPM of 2 years for patients <13 years, and this may have introduced time-dependent bias.
Because this study was a retrospective review of electronic health records from pediatric
nephrology clinics, we did not have access to actual BP readings or measurement technique
from referring providers’ records. As a result, subjects were likely referred to the pediatric
nephrologists and entered the study cohort in a nonstandard way. Although it might have
been interesting to assess changes in target organ damage between those with stable vs
changing ABPM phenotypes, this was not possible given the study design. Second, although
this longitudinal cohort of youth with white coat hypertension is one of the largest to
date, the sample size was small and likely reduced our power to detect small effect size
differences. We note that our estimates are imprecise with wide 95% CIs in the multivariable
models, and this may have been improved with a larger sample size. Our study was based
on a convenience sample where study data were collected voluntarily from retrospective
chart reviews at multiple Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium centers, and thus,
sample size and power calculations were not performed prior to data collection. Third,
imperfect ABPM reproducibility could have contributed to a relatively high percentage of
patients who progressed to abnormal ABPM phenotype. Both adult and pediatric studies
have investigated reproducibility,27-30 and overall, ABPM has superior reproducibility over
clinic BP measurements in the short term.31 However, a longitudinal study in adults
showed low reproducibility for white coat hypertension and masked hypertension over a
4-year period,32 supporting the need for periodic re-evaluation. In the previously mentioned
pediatric longitudinal ABPM study, the phenotype changed in 58 of 124 children, with 16%
worsening and 31% improving.7 Whether the changes in phenotypes observed in our study
were due to inherent reproducibility issues vs evolution of the individuals’ phenotypes is
unknown. Regardless, it is important for clinicians to perform ABPM follow-up for patients
with white coat hypertension who may develop additional hypertension and cardiovascular
risk factors in their adolescent and young adult years. Lastly, we acknowledge that we chose

to use age as a categorical variable (<12 years old vs 12-17 years old) rather than more
biological continuous variable for the reasons described above in the method section.
Given the limitations above, future studies with a larger cohort and prospective design are
needed to confirm these findings, to evaluate additional predictors of progression, and to
properly determine risk factors. These studies will aid in formulating future pediatric ABPM
clinical practice guidelines to define optimal follow-up frequency, methodology, and interval
time.

Abstract
Background: Guidelines recommend screening for primary aldosteronism in patients diagnosed
with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Recent studies have shown that adherence
to these recommendations is extremely low. It has been suggested that cost is a barrier to
implementation. No analysis has been done to rigorously evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
widespread implementation of these guidelines.
Methods: We constructed a decision-analytic model to evaluate screening of the hypertensive
obstructive sleep apnea population for primary aldosteronism as per guideline recommendations in
comparison with current rates of screening. Probabilities, utility values, and costs were identified
in the literature. Threshold and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness of the model. Costs were
represented in 2020 US dollars and health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years. The model
assumed a societal perspective with a lifetime time horizon.
Results: Screening per guideline recommendations had an expected cost of $47,016 and
35.27 quality-adjusted life-years. Continuing at current rates of screening had an expected
cost of $48,350 and 34.86 quality-adjusted life-years. Screening was dominant, as it was both
less costly and more effective. These results were robust to sensitivity analysis of disease
prevalence, test sensitivity, patient age, and expected outcome of medical or surgical treatment
of primary aldosteronism. The screening strategy remained cost-effective even if screening were
conservatively presumed to identify only 3% of new primary aldosteronism cases.

Conclusions: For patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, rigorous screening
for primary aldosteronism is cost-saving due to cardiovascular risk averted. Cost should not be a
barrier to improving primary aldosteronism screening adherence.
Background
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a frequent etiology of secondary hypertension. Although
previously thought to be a rare diagnosis with a relatively benign impact, it is now
recognized to represent 5% to 10% of all hypertension cases and 12% to 22% of resistant
hypertension.1-5 Further, PA bears a risk profile that is substantially higher than that of
essential hypertension.2,6-8 A proportion of these patients—those with unilateral etiologies
of hyperaldosteronism such as aldosteronoma or unilateral hyperplasia—may achieve cure
with surgery, and those who are eligible for medical management benefit meaningfully from
early targeted treatment.9
Underdiagnosis of PA is a major public health issue.10,11 As hypertension affects 32% to
46% of people in the United States, 5% to 10% of all hypertensive patients represents 10 to
16 million people in this country alone who could benefit from an accurate, timely diagnosis
of PA.12 Global prevalence of hypertension is estimated at 1 billion people with proportional
potential benefit.13
Delayed intervention risks avoidable target organ injury. Hyperaldosteronism provokes
vascular and cardiac fibrosis, and the resulting increased complication rates are independent
of blood pressure levels.14 Among blood-pressure-matched hypertensive patients, those with
PA have significantly higher rates of poor cardiovascular outcomes, including coronary
artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.6,7,15 Targeted treatment with
adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been shown to equilibrate
cardiovascular complications between these groups.16,17 Younger patients appear to benefit
most from treatment, supporting the concept of a direct relationship between duration of
disease and morbidity.10,18
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly recognized to coexist with PA, with data
suggesting a causal link owing to aldosterone induced peripharyngeal fluid retention that
increases airway resistance.19,20 This has led both the Endocrine Society and the American
Heart Association to advocate for PA screening among hypertensive patients with an OSA
diagnosis in their most recent guidelines.2,12 Adherence to these guidelines has been shown
to be extremely poor. Ruhle et al reported a screening rate of only 3.0% for PA in
hypertensive patients with OSA.21 Among patients with hypertension and any indication
for PA screening, Sivarajah et al reported a screening rate of just 1.3%. Among those
with hypertension and OSA, this figure was 1.7%.22 European rates of screening are also
poor. Among 500 primary care providers in Italy and Germany, Mulatero et al documented
awareness of PA screening eligibility at 8% and 13%, respectively.23 Cost is often suggested
as a barrier to implementation of the guideline recommendations, and a cost-effectiveness
analysis has been called for.10

We hypothesized that, given the expense of arguably avoidable downstream cardiac
outcomes, screening for PA in the OSA population might be more financially sound than
assumed. No previous analysis has considered this question, so we developed a decision-
analytic model to evaluate screening of the hypertensive OSA population for PA.
Methods
Model structure
We developed a Markov model using TreeAge Pro (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown,
MA) that allowed us to compare a robust screening program adhering to Endocrine Society
consensus guidelines with contemporary documented rates of screening in the hypertensive
OSA population. Screening was defined as an aldosterone-renin ratio plus confirmatory
testing in the form of a saline infusion test. Because not all patients actually require
confirmatory testing, this overestimates the cost of the screening strategy. We chose this
conservative estimate because it would add pressure to the model contrary to our hypothesis.
The model structure (Fig 1) was developed to reflect management of hypertension in
the United States. The initial branch point is screening per Endocrine Society consensus
guidelines (per guideline, PG) versus current published rates of adherence to the guidelines
(current adherence, CA). Thereafter, the model unfolds to reflect likelihood of PA diagnosis,
subtype classification, and results of medical and surgical management, and then flows to
a cardiovascular morbidity and mortality module as developed by Smith et al.24 Transition
probabilities, costs, and health state utilities are based on literature review, and the model
cycles annually. The model assumes a societal perspective with a lifetime time horizon. A
3% discounting is applied to costs and QALYs as is standard practice to acknowledge that
future costs as well as effects tend to be less valued than current ones. The base case is a
40-year-old adult with hypertension and OSA diagnoses. PA is diagnosed in adults 20 to 60
years old, with a mean age of diagnosis reported in the late fourth decade of life. Patients
with PA typically have a history of hypertension for several years before formal diagnosis;
therefore, we chose 40 years old as a reasonable estimation of the relevant at-risk population
for the base case scenario.25
Important assumptions underlie this model. First, all patients are surgical candidates, and,
second, all those who are diagnosed with surgically treatable disease undergo surgery. Third,
all patients identified as having non–surgically treatable disease receive medical treatment.
Finally, we assume constant annual risk of progression to cardiovascular outcomes, though
it is likely that these risks actually increase over time given the progressive deleterious
effects of hypertension and aldosterone exposure. We did not find data in the literature
to characterize this increase accurately. Therefore, we are probably overestimating life
expectancy in both arms of the model. Arguably in this case, we could have used a non-
lifetime time horizon to ameliorate the effects of this assumption, but given the long-term
and significant mortality effects of essential hypertension and PA, we decided that it was
more accurate to use the lifetime time horizon and acknowledge this tension.
This project was exempted from institutional review board approval because it involved no
human subjects nor protected health information.

Transition probabilities
Best estimates for transition probabilities were derived from the literature (Table I).
Cardiovascular risk transition probabilities represented Framingham Study data used in
previously published cost-effectiveness work.24 Mortality and complication rates, stratified
by age, pertaining to laparoscopic adrenalectomy were sourced from previously published
cost-effectiveness studies and were originally derived from the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample.33
Overall, PA confers a higher risk of cardiovascular events than essential hypertension
regardless of treatment. In this model, cardiovascular risks associated with surgically treated
and medically treated PA are represented as hazard ratios multiplied by the risks associated
with essential hypertension. A published hazard ratio was available for medically treated PA
in the base case (1.91), but due to a lack of clear consensus in the literature and variation
in success related to treatment regimens (eg, Hundemer et al reported that PA patients
treated with mineralocorticoid antagonists had a cardiovascular risk profile that was 3 times
that of essential hypertension patients if the plasma renin activity remained suppressed but
became equivalent to essential hypertension patients when the plasma renin activity was no
longer suppressed), a wide interval was used in sensitivity analysis.6,9 Surgically treatable
disease is in some cases curative, but published rates of success vary widely (27%–94%)
and depend on the definitions of cure used (complete clinical success, complete biochemical
success, normotensive status with or without medications).7,18,32 Delay to diagnosis, among
other factors, may impact the efficacy of treatment and may be an underlying source of
this variability. Again, we selected a representative base case and used a wide interval
in sensitivity analysis to determine how more extreme estimates would impact model
predictions.
Published estimates of the prevalence of PA in OSA patients vary substantially. In a study
of 325 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with hypertension, Di Murro et al reported
an OSA diagnosis in 53 patients, and a concurrent PA diagnosis in 18 patients, for a
prevalence of 34%. In contrast, Buffalo et al reported an 8.9% prevalence of PA among
203 hypertensive patients with OSA. Both studies suffer from small sample size. We chose
to take a simple mean of these prevalence estimates as our base case and used the values
reported in these studies for the range of our sensitivity analysis.
Costs
Cost inputs, including screening, testing, and age-stratified costs related to adrenalectomy,
were identified from the literature and from the United States Medicare reimbursement
schedule.26,36 All costs were adjusted to 2020 United States dollars using the Consumer
Price Index for urban consumers.
Health state utilities
Effectiveness was represented in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a standard measure
used in health economic studies. QALYs are equivalent to the product of a health utility
value pertaining to a health state and the length of time spent in that state. By convention,

1 year of fully healthy life is equivalent to 1 QALY, and death is equivalent to 0 QALYs.
Health state utilities were derived from the literature.
Analysis
Base case and sensitivity analyses were performed. As is standard practice for cost-
effectiveness analysis, our aim was to compare strategies and determine whether either
was dominant (less costly and more effective) or, if not, to characterize the tradeoff of cost
for effectiveness by identifying an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Univariate
or first-order sensitivity analyses—in which a variable is altered independently along its
range while all others are held at their base case estimates—were conducted on all input
variables, and those with notable effect on the model were further interrogated with
threshold analysis. Ranges for sensitivity analysis were identified in the literature. When
ranges were unavailable in the literature, a range of 0.5 to 1.5 times the base case estimate
was used. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which multiple variables are
varied along their ranges simultaneously, was performed to examine parameter uncertainty.
Willingness-to-pay, the societally determined value at which an intervention is deemed
cost-effective, was set at $150,000 per QALY in accordance with guidance for healthcare
cost-effectiveness in the United States published by the American College of Cardiology and
the American Heart Association.45
Results
Base case
In the base case, PG was the dominant (less costly and more effective) strategy, with a cost
of $47,016 and utility of 35.27 QALYs. CA cost $48,350 and produced a utility of 34.86
QALYs (Table II). Therefore, a robust screening program for identifying PA in hypertensive
patients with OSA was the optimal strategy.
Sensitivity analysis
In univariate (first-order) sensitivity analysis, in which the model is run for each individual
variable along the entirety of its anticipated range, 3 variables produced a positive ICER
at some point along their ranges: the probability of stroke in patients with PA, patient
age (starting age for the model), and the hazard ratio related to surgical treatment. ICERs
were no higher than $13,000/QALY for any of these variables. These results are presented
in a tornado diagram, which is a pictorial representation of individual univariate analyses
presented together so that their impact on the model can be compared (Fig 2). Specifically,
as the risk of stroke in patients with PA decreases, PG ceases to be dominant but remains
cost-effective at a point estimate of 0.007. The highest ICER produced by the variable’s
expected value range is $12,805/QALY. Patient age refers to the starting age as patients enter
the model. As this age increases, PG ceases to be dominant and becomes cost-effective at
a point estimate of 76.7 years. The highest ICER produced along this variable’s range is
$8,048/QALY. As surgical treatment becomes less effective at ameliorating the effects of PA,
screening ceases to be dominant at a point estimate of 2.59 and is instead cost-effective with
a maximum ICER of $2,738/QALY. No thresholds were identified beyond which the CA
strategy was optimal.

Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis (second-order sensitivity analysis) was
performed to assess parameter uncertainty in the model (Fig 3). In this technique, multiple
inputs are varied along their anticipated ranges simultaneously. Project Evaluation and
Review Technique distributions were used. In 84% of 5,000 iterations, PG was found to be
dominant, and in an additional 13%, PG was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold
of $150,000. Therefore, in 97% of 5,000 iterations, PG was the optimal strategy.
An extended threshold analysis was conducted to determine how effective PG would have
to be in the base case to remain cost-effective. This was done by exploring the behavior of
a variable that represented the probability that PA would be diagnosed with the proposed
screening regimen, which was calculated from the sensitivity of the aldosterone-renin ratio
and specificity of the saline infusion test. Using a range of 0 to 100% revealed a threshold
of 3%. If PG screening identified only 3% of new cases of PA in the OSA population, it
would remain cost-effective. Given that the low end of the expected range for this variable is
calculated to be 38%, this should be highly feasible.
Discussion
PA is a major public health issue with available effective intervention options that may
reduce morbidity and mortality. Increased cardiac risk associated with untreated PA is well--
established,3,6,9 and surgically correctable PA is a curable disease.32 Enriched prevalence of
PA in the OSA population makes this group a potential target for focused surveillance and
intervention.2,20
Adherence to guidelines that encourage increased screening for PA in the OSA population
is poor, and cost has been suggested as a barrier.21,22 Here we demonstrate that a robust
screening program for PA in hypertensive patients with OSA is cost-saving, and even at the
outer reaches of sensitivity analysis, it remains definitively cost-effective.
The base case of our model suggests that a robust screening program for PA in the OSA
population is more effective and less costly than current practice, owing to the substantial
monetary and health utility costs of resulting cardiac morbidity and mortality. In first-order
sensitivity analysis, there are some scenarios in which PG is not dominant but remains
cost-effective with ICERs that are comfortably within generally accepted standards of cost-
effectiveness. Second-order sensitivity analysis, accounting for parameter uncertainty, still
identifies robust screening as the optimal pathway.
These results are consistent with existing literature describing cost-effectiveness with regard
to PA. Lubitz et al conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis examining several strategies
for screening for PA and subtype diagnosis in the resistant hypertensive population in the
United States. This group reported that screening with an aldosterone to renin ratio and
CT scan followed by AVS was cost-effective in this population at $82,000/QALY.27 Sato et
al performed a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating screening for PA in Japan in patients
with stage I–III hypertension, reporting a cost of 4,923,385 JPY/life-year (approximately
$45,000/life-year), which was cost-effective.46 Velasco et al showed a cost-saving benefit of
screening patients with resistant hypertension, excluding those patients whose diagnosis of

resistant hypertension may have been in error due to medication nonadherence.47 Studies
have shown that for those forms of PA that are surgically correctable, surgery delivers
lifetime costs that are lower than medical treatment.48,49
Our analysis is limited by the inherent nature of any modeling study—certain assumptions
must be made that may oversimplify complex clinical scenarios and decision-making
processes. Furthermore, conclusions drawn from the model are only as valuable as its inputs
are accurate. Specifically, there were several variables for which clear, discrete values were
unavailable. This was due to differences in practice with regard to clinical evaluation and
medical treatment of PA, variable definitions of successful medical and surgical treatment,
and variably reported rates of successful treatment with surgical and medical therapy.10,50
This required us to choose best estimates for the base case and to rely on very wide
confidence intervals in sensitivity analysis to compensate for uncertainty. The consequences
of delayed diagnosis are also not represented in this model but are clearly important
clinically. Duration of hypertension has been associated with less treatable disease, arguing
once again in favor of the PG strategy.2
It is unclear why more screening in the hypertensive OSA population is not taking place,
as indicated by recent studies.21,22 The cost-prohibitive nature of widespread screening has
been suggested as one reason. Our study investigated this question and demonstrated that
cost should not be a factor. Indeed, screening may be cost-saving over a long-time horizon.
Current guidelines are sound, reasonable, and have the potential to save lives. If cost is not
the issue, then one can proceed to identifying and addressing other barriers with thoughtful
interventions. Awareness among referring providers may be another factor that deserves
investigation and action.
For patients with hypertension and OSA, screening for PA is cost-saving due to
cardiovascular risk averted. In efforts to address this major public health issue, cost should
not be a barrier to improving PA screening adherence in the OSA population.
Biographies
Dr. Michael Yeh (Los Angeles): I recently learned about this association between
hyperaldosteronism and obstructive sleep apnea. What is the direction of causality, and what
is the biological mechanism?
Dr. Kathryn Chomsky-Higgins Menut: There's evidence that it's bi-directional, but this
idea of aldosterone causing accumulation of pharyngeal edema as a causative element
towards the development of obstructive sleep apnea, that is the best description that we have
found and is the leading theory at this point.
Dr. Michael Yeh (Los Angeles): I know that the more we screen for primary aldosteronism,
the more we find, and yet the fraction of surgically remediable cases goes down the more we
screen, because we find more hyperplasia. How did that figure into your cost analysis?
Dr. Kathryn Chomsky-Higgins Menut: I think the really important point is that even by
finding more hyperplasia, that is also treatable with targeted treatments. If we identify

primary aldosteronism that is only treatable medically, where there is not a unilateral
cause, then we can treat that with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. There are data
from matched cohorts of people with essential hypertension and people with primary
aldosteronism. For blood pressure matched cohorts, the people with primary aldosteronism
have worse outcomes. But, importantly, with targeted treatment, particularly in younger
patients, both with surgery and with medical treatment, they can be brought back down to
the risk level of essential hypertension. I think regardless of whether we can treat them
surgically, it's just as important to identify patients who can be treated medically.
Dr. Amanda Laird (New Brunswick): Is there an age at which screening would no longer
be cost-effective? Or is cost-effectiveness more related to comorbid conditions?
Dr. Kathryn Chomsky-Higgins Menut: Well, in our study, we used the base case age of
40 and also did a sensitivity analysis that found that at about age 76, doing a comprehensive
screening program is not dominant but is still cost-effective. Now, that's assuming a patient
who is a surgical candidate. In this particular analysis, we did not account for other
comorbid conditions.
Dr. Michael Yeh (Los Angeles): Because yours is the first of several cost-effectiveness
papers, can you articulate for the audience the difference between dominant and cost-
effective?
Dr. Kathryn Chomsky-Higgins Menut: Dominant is less costly and more effective. In
these analyses, you might be expecting that one treatment is going to cost a little bit more,
but you're going to get enough effectiveness to make it worthwhile, essentially. But even
better is if a treatment is both more effective and it costs less. That's what we want in the
base case.
Dr. Mahes Sivarajah (New York): You’ve shown that cost isn't the issue. What do you
think are the barriers? What would you propose to improve our screening rates?
Dr. Kathryn Chomsky-Higgins Menut: First of all, thank you for your paper that I read in
making my analysis. Second, I think this is ripe for a quality improvement initiative.
There are no excuses. We have identified that for screening, you want something easy to do
that's relatively low cost and low risk for which you have an actual targeted treatment. That
is true here in primary aldosteronism. That is the reason why it's in these guidelines.
Clearly, we need more outreach to the primary care community, and I think this is a real
opportunity to build a program to do that, perhaps with AAES. So awareness is the primary
need. I hope that with this cost-effectiveness analysis we have shown that cost is not an
excuse to avoid more screening.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results of the PSA are shown on an incremental cost-

dominant (represented in the right lower quadrant) or cost-effective (represented in the right
upper quadrant, to the right of the willingness-to-pay line). Circles represent iterations in
which PG is superior, and squares represent iterations in which the Current Adherence
strategy is superior.

SUMMARY
The Hypertension Community has three conflicting dilemmas, a goal systolic pressure of 120
mmHg or less (The SPRINT Trials), 40% of our 60,000,000 hypertensives still sustain blood
pressures above 140/90 mmHg and our most potent antihypertensive drug minoxidil sits on the
side-lines, imprisoned in the FDA’s Black Box Designation. My solutions to these dilemmas are:
#1. Review of the facts of our most potent antihypertensive drug minoxidil which is essentially
free of toxicity, #2. Treatment focus on the fundamental cause of High Blood Pressure, excess
dietary sodium and, #3. Prevention of, and/or reversal of, the fundamental mechanism of
worsening hypertension, arteriolar hypertrophy.
My focus at U.T. Southwestern in Dallas was on extremely severely hypertensive patients with a
quantifiable, measurable complication of high blood pressure, progression of nephrosclerotic
damage to kidneys. This model had the greatest likelihood of exposing fundamental dis-regulatory
mechanisms in hypertensive patients (which it did) and the potential for study of the most relevant
antihypertensive drug interactions to achieve optimal blood pressure control (which it did). By
maintaining diastolic pressures at 80 mmHg or less in the first NIH supported, long term
randomized clinical trial to save the kidneys, the bases for a fundamental blood pressure support
mechanism (arteriolar hypertrophy) was illuminated but not fully described until now. This
fundamental hypertensinogenic mechanism results from HBP but with time and severity,
becomes its own raison d’être.
I am now 84 years of age. As a result of a stroke 20 years ago which caused permanent double
vision and because of poor blood pressure control with triple therapy I started using minoxidil 5
mg/day along with atenolol and occasional furosemide. Now, along with some dietary salt
restriction, my resting blood pressure is 110/65–125/75 and, in spite of > 30 year history of HBP, I
have no retinal arteriolar hypertrophy nor arcus senilis (Dr. Schwartz-U. of Miami) which is
almost universally present at this age. YES, prevention of, or reversal of, arteriolar hypertrophy
should be a central focus of HBP treatment. I simply wish to share a bit of accumulated wisdom
that might be of use to others.
INTRODUCTION
Results of the recent SPRINT Trials (1,2) demand that we and the Food & Drug
Administration (FDA) reassess the clinical use of minoxidil (Loniten), our most potent
antihypertensive drug. The goal systolic blood pressure in the SPRINT Trials in the Strict

Control Group was 120 mmHg. Complications of High Blood Pressure (HBP) in this group
were reduced except that renal function appeared to decline in the Strict Control Group
(discussed below with edema and the PRAS Syndrome). An embarrassing fact to our
hypertension community is that over 40% of hypertensives’ blood pressure is sustained
above 140/90 mmHg in the USA (3). Even though Minoxidil is virtually free of toxicity the
FDA has essentially shut down its use by a Black Box Designation. This designation
resulted from two side effects (cardiac symptoms and edema) that could have been, and
should have been controlled by companion drugs which, in fact, potentiate minoxidil’s
efficacy.
Chidsey’s prophetic analysis (4) in 1973 of minoxidil’s role was ignored by the FDA and by
the medical community. He noted that “minoxidil’s extraordinary efficacy when combined
with a diuretic and beta-receptor blocker, lack of tolerance for two years, and its paucity of
side effects suggests that this agent may be of great value in the chronic therapy of
hypertension”.
Our interest in minoxidil was precipitated by its historic role in arresting the tragic
procedure of removing both kidneys of patients with refractory hypertension and advanced
nephrosclerosis (5). It soon became apparent that far better blood pressure control was
needed to “save-the-kidneys” and that more understanding of drug interactions with
minoxidil and blood pressure support mechanisms might enable us to achieve better blood
pressure control. These interactions extend to fascinating intra-renal mechanisms involving
arteriolar hypertrophy, adrenergic receptors, renin-angiotensin and the increasingly
recognized cause of reversible renal failure from drugs, the Pseudo Renal Artery Stenosis
Syndrome (PRASS) (6). Interestingly, mechanisms of PRASS (to be discussed) were the
cause of poor kidney outcomes in the SPRINT trial in the Elderly (2) in the Strict Blood
Pressure Control Group (37 events) vs Conventional (13 events) blood pressure control
group. All other indices of outcomes were improved in the “Strict” (<120 mmHg systolic
pressure) control group.
Our early goal was to reduce diastolic blood pressure to <80 mmHg (minoxidil was required
in all patients) in the most severely hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients prior to
randomization into two groups. In one randomized group we attempted to maintain diastolic
pressures below 80 mmHg and in the other to permit diastolic pressure to be maintained
above 90 mmHg by reducing drug dosages. Analogies to this strategy was subsequently
applied in the two SPRINT Trial Designs (1,2).
The interactions reviewed herein relate to impressive activation of the sympathetic nervous
system and renal retention of sodium leading to edema. Because of the power of the four
mechanisms causing edema from minoxidil, emphasis is placed on restriction of dietary
sodium by documenting the real Minimum Daily Requirement (MDR) for sodium (<0.2 G/
Day).
When compared to most other antihypertensive drugs minoxidil is unique in several ways:
#1 Minoxidil dilates pre-capillary arterioles. Arteriolar hypertrophy (discussed
later) results from from High Blood Pressure (HBP). Because of encroachment

on the arteriolar lumen it becomes a fundamental hypertensinogenic mechanism
independent of the initiating cause.
#2 Minoxidil is as an agonist drug. Receptor blockers or enzyme inhibitors
suppress only the ambient level of activity of their specific blood pressure
support mechanism whereas an agonist has a full range of pharmacologic
activity.
#3 Minoxidil has a 3–4 day duration of action. It binds strongly to its arteriolar
site of action via a covalent (sulfydryl) linkage. Therefore its pharmacologic
effects are cumulative with constant daily dosing for up to a week at which time
its efficacy reaches a plateau; once daily dosage should suffice. This
pharmacologic property of minoxidil may be the determining factor of its
greater efficacy in clinical use than the vasodilator hydralazine (Apresoline).
#4 Minoxidil stimulates/maintains hair growth. This effect is highly variable
from patient to patient and a mixed bag indeed. Because its site and mechanism
of action is on vascular smooth muscle leading to increased blood flow, future
minoxidil research should include diseases potentially related to ischemia.
These include age-related hearing loss and penile erectile dysfunction for which
use-patents (not mine) are on file. If age related dementias are due to ischemia
minoxidil might have efficacy therein as well.
Fortunately, we had a large coterie of severely hypertensive patients at Parkland Hospital in
Dallas in whom we could do full dose-response curves of each of the types of
antihypertensive drugs superimposed on two or on three other drugs at fixed doses. We
monitored indices of each blood pressure support mechanism including supine and standing
Serum Renin Activity (SRA) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations and
vasoconstrictor effects using the selective antagonists P-113 (Saralasin) for angiotensin (Ang
II) and phentolamine or prazosin for NE. In some studies we measured cardiac output,
venous compliance, peripheral and pulmonary vascular resistance and, of course, blood
pressures with various drug combinations. Mechanistic studies of these interactions and
blood pressure support mechanisms were also done in genetic hypertensive and
normotensive animals and in isolated perfused rat kidneys.
PHARMACOLOGY
My focus is on the mechanisms of side effects of minoxidil and control thereof by
companion drugs with the goal of “opening the door” for physicians to take advantage of its
unique efficacy. For traditional aspects of minoxidil pharmacology see reviews (7–9).
#1. CARDIAC REFLEX EFFECTS
Minoxidil’s antihypertensive site of action is arteriolar smooth muscle; active-agonist
dilation at this site decreases peripheral resistance thereby lowering blood pressure.
Lowering of blood pressure by any mechanism other than suppressing of, or blocking
sympathetic neuronal effects, causes reflex activation of the sympathetic neural release of

norepinephrine (Figure 1) onto peripheral alpha (alphaAR) and beta-adrenergic receptors
(betaAR).
Failure to control this reflex activation (Figure 2) or its effects, especially with higher doses
of minoxidil, causes increased heart rate, myocardial contractility, arrhythmias and even
myocardial infarction. Failure of physicians to control this minoxidil-induced reflex
activation contributed to the FDA’s Black-Box Designation, thereby restricting and limiting
minoxidil usage to drug-resistant hypertension and scaring physicians away from its use
because of potential litigation.
Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) with various antihypertensive drug
combinations are shown in Figure 1. Hypertensives tended to have slightly (not statistically
significant) higher plasma norepinephrine levels and there was a gradation throughout more
severely hypertensive patients as a function of the requirement for more powerful drug
combinations. High plasma NE concentrations were reversed by clonidine or methyldopa
which lower blood pressure by their site of action on alpha2-adrenoceptors (10) (alpha2A) in
the cardiovascular control center in the brain (11).
Veins are like a sewer for disposal of NE released from sympathetic nerve endings so its
concentration in venous blood is an index of sympathetic neuronal activity. Circulating
levels of NE are normally below the level for vasoconstriction. However, the circulating
levels (Figure 1) with higher doses of minoxidil are in the range of circulating NE
concentrations in pheochromocytoma. Interestingly, the effects of excess NE released from
sympathetic nerve terminals directly onto receptors (ie. due to reflex activation) contrasts
remarkably from effects of high circulating NE levels from pheochromocytoma, a concept
deserving of further comment in a discussion of minoxidil edema and effects of clonidine
(see below) on the edema.
Hydralazine (Apresoline) and reflex cardiac stimulation—Hydralazine, like
minoxidil is an agonist vasodilator but is also a specific angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
(12). In the model (ganglionic blockaded, anesthetized rat) in which this property was
discovered vasodilators shifted angiotensin and norepinephrine dose response curves to the
right equally except for hydralazine. Hydralazine shifted the DRC for angiotensin much
further to the right than NE and therefore is also a selective ARB. The shift of DRCs by 40+
vasodilators correlated quantitatively with antihypertensive activity in genetic hypertensive
and DOCA-sodium hypertensive rats (12). Interestingly, the enzyme inhibiting capacity of
phosphodiesterase inhibitors (caffeine, theophylline, and 20 other un-named drugs) were
directly proportional to their antihypertensive and vasodilating potencies (12), thus linking
causality of these three properties.
Because of this combined pharmacologic property (ARB plus vasodilator), hydralazine
caused cardiac arrhythmias and infarctions in the emergency room of Parkland Hospital
when hydralazine was administered intravenously for extreme blood pressure elevation.
Consequently, we abandoned its use in this manner. Alternatively, orally administered
minoxidil has been used for rapid control of extreme elevations of blood pressure (13,14)
and I have used it this way as well. Alpert (13) started with a 20 mg dose of minoxidil

superimposed on a beta-blocker and furosemide and added 5–20 mg four hours later if
necessary. One could start with 5–10 mg initially (after a beta-blocker) and add to the dose
at 3–4 hour intervals with careful monitoring. Importantly, it is simpler and easier to use
than nitroprusside or even diazoxide. However, if heart failure-pulmonary edema are present
nitroprusside infusion is preferable because of veno-dilation and reduction of venous return
by this drug, thereby reducing cardiac work-load.
Even with the combination of pharmacologic effects, hydralazine is less potent as a blood
pressure lowering agent than minoxidil as first noted by Chidsey (4) and in our own
experience. Keep in mind however, that hydralazine was a major component of the drug
combination used in the transformative VA Cooperative studies coordinated by Fries (15,16),
so this drug clearly has efficacy in controlling blood pressure and preventing complications.
Note the expression of Fries’ wisdom of the use of reserpine (site of action is in the CNS
like clonidine and methyl-dopa) in Figure 2. Hydralazine causes headaches and occasional
lupus erythematosis at doses of 200 mg/day and higher.
#2. MINOXIDIL EDEMA
Four physiologic mechanisms contribute to edema from minoxidil, each of which are
dependent on excess dietary sodium (see below). These mechanisms are:
#1. Capillary Leakage—A function of precapillary arterioles is to prevent excess blood
flow into capillaries when blood pressure is temporarily increased. Long-standing high
blood pressure from any cause leads to hypertrophy of this circular smooth muscle (Figure
3), encroachment on the lumen and increased passive resistance to blood flow. Therefore
arteriolar hypertrophy becomes a fundamental mechanism of sustaining high blood pressure
per se. Arteriolar dilation, especially with minoxidil, increases blood flow into capillaries
thereby increasing their transmural pressure gradient which shifts water into extracellular
spaces thereby contributing to edema formation, which is highly variable among patients.
#2. Reduced Glomerular Filtration Pressure—Because salt excretion is partially
pressure dependent as described by Guyton (17), the extraordinary lowering of blood
pressure capacity of minoxidil (combined with other drugs) increases passive (independent
of aldosterone) renal retention of sodium and water thereby contributing to edema.
#3. Renal Nerve Released NE—This mechanism for minoxidil-induced edema is due to
increased sympathetic nerve release of NE directly onto alpha1As in the kidney which
causes sodium retention (18–20). This mechanism of sodium-water retention predominates
over the high circulating NE levels (as in pheochromocytoma-see below) which suppress
release of NE through the inhibitory action of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors (10).
Interestingly, vasopressin also has a direct renal effect of retaining sodium in addition to its
water retaining action (21). Since we did not study any vasopressin antagonists nor blood
levels of this peptide we cannot exclude an important salt and water retaining role of
vasopressin in minoxidil edema. Interestingly, excess antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin)
secretion syndrome in myxedema is associated with low serum sodium (even less than 105
meq/liter) (22) which appears inconsistent with a direct renal effect of sodium retention by

this hormone. However, mineralocorticoids potentiate vasopressin’s effects on salt and water
retention. Thus, the volume expansion mechanism suppressing aldosterone secretion appears
to be absolute in continuing urinary sodium excretion (in spite of serum sodium
concentrations as low as 100 meq/liter) in the syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of
Antidiuretic Hormone (22).
#4. Beta adrenoceptor mediated renin release—Finally, sympathetic nerve
activation stimulates renin release via a beta-adrenoceptor (23,24) on the juxtaglomerular
apparatus, angiotensin formation and synthesis and release of aldosterone, the sodium-
retaining hormone. This minoxidil-augmented renin release is largely blocked by beta-
adrenoceptor blocking agents, a major blood pressure lowering mechanism in this
antihypertensive drug combination in man and in animals (23,24).
Contrasting effects on edema of high sympathetic nerve-released NE versus high
circulating NE as in pheochromocytoma. Minoxidil-induced sympathetic nerve released
NE onto renal tubules induces reabsorption of sodium causing edema (#3 above).
Alternatively, high circulating levels of NE from pheochromocytoma have two opposite
effects on salt and water excretion. One is to constrict veins which forces stored blood to the
heart, and by the Starling Mechanism, propels the excess blood to the kidney and forces salt
and water excretion (17). The second mechanism of high circulating NE in
pheochromocytoma to increase salt and water excretion is to activate pre-synaptic alpha2As
which inhibit sympathetic neuronal release of NE (10) on renal tubules and thereby to
reduce sodium retention. Intravascular volume depletion by these two mechanisms in
pheochromocytoma can be so severe that patients may even fall from the sitting position
because of orthostatic hypotension. Alternatively, orthostatic hypotension is absent with
minoxidil because of this drug’s four cumulative mechanisms (see above) causing renal
retention of salt and water resulting in volume expansion.
Why not just use the alpha1AB prazosin to prevent minoxidil’s reflex mediated salt-
retention-edema (#3 above)?” What a fine idea! However, after three days of prazosin
administration, alpha2As multiply, move into the post-synaptic site on renal tubules and
mediate nerve stimulated salt and water retention (25), the otherwise exclusive domain of
alpha1As. A similar multiplication of alpha2As with prazosin and substitution for alpha2As
on veins may explain temporary (2–3 days) orthostatic hypotension with alpha1ABs and
very short term benefits in congestive heart failure (26). I don’t know whether some degree
of tolerance (to relief of urethral obstruction) occurs when alpha1ABs are used to relieve
urethral obstruction from prostatic hypertrophy.
Failure of physicians to optimally combine counteracting drugs with minoxidil to control
effects of the reflex activation caused cardiac stimulation and edema. On the flip side of this
issue is the occasional patient with poor cardiac conduction as in the “sick-sinus-syndrome”.
In some patients with this syndrome I have used minoxidil in lower doses (ie. 10 mg)
without a beta-blocker to enhance conduction through activation of beta-adrenergic receptors
in the heart. Such use of minoxidil is possible because of its constant, long duration of
increased sympathetic neuronal release of NE for which tolerance does not develop. This
mechanism substituted for having pace-makers installed in some of my patients.

Cause and effect relationships of antihypertensive drug interactions (Figure 2) were
confirmed using selective blockers (prazosin, saralasin, propranolol) of each receptor type.
BetaAB such as propranolol or atenolol, when added to minoxidil, lower blood pressure
impressively by inhibiting the exaggerated renin release (23,24). The renin-angiotensin limb
in Figure 2 can become a critical support mechanism when minoxidil is used alone (28) as
shown in Figure 3. Without a betaAB such as propranolol SRA is high and infusion of the
A2B saralasin can cause extreme lowering (27) of blood pressure (Figure 4).
Since converting enzyme inhibitors such as Captopril, Ang II RB or inhibitors of the renin
enzyme have similar anti-angiotensin profiles (28), these drugs should be used very carefully
with a vasodilator.
EDEMA AND THE MINIMUM DAILY REQUIREMENT (MDR) FOR SODIUM
Excess dietary sodium is a prerequisite for edema from minoxidil and is the cause of high
blood pressure in the vast majority of hypertensive patients. So how much sodium do we
really need, or “What is the Real MDR for sodium?”
Here are two scientific fact bases for the MDR for sodium:
#1 Millions of people with dietary sodium intake of < 9 milliequivalents (meq)/day
(0.2 grams) have no high blood pressure nor its complications and don’t even
have obesity nor diabetes (29,30). Their blood pressure does not even increase
with age and their exercise tolerance is excellent. I constructed a pseudo-dose
response curve by combining blood pressure as a function of dietary sodium
intake from the Intersalt studies (29,30), and the salt-blood pressure study of
Mente et. al. (31) in Figure 5. The Mente Study also indicated a quantitative
relationship between salt intake and blood pressure but over a narrow and very
high range of salt intake. Clearly, the MDR for sodium is < 0.2 grams/day.
#2 I personally conducted studies in hypertensive patients ingesting diets containing
9 meq/day of sodium (0.207 grams) in NIH supported Clinical Research Centers
at the U. of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, at Vanderbilt in
Nashville, TN and at NIH’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Note the
placement on the dose-response curve of 0.207 grams sodium/day.
Blood pressure was reduced in every patient by reducing sodium intake for two weeks but
none to the level associated with the same salt intake for people shown in Figure 5; why
not? I suspect that failure to lower blood pressure over a short time interval (two weeks) of
lowered salt intake was due to residual arteriolar hypertrophy (Figure 3) in my patients that
had resulted from long-standing high blood pressure (see below). Clearly the MDR for
sodium is < 0.2 grams/day and political pressure should be put upon the USDA to reduce
this toxic addictive poison (kills more people than opiates, car accidents and terrorists’ guns
combined) on food labels in our grocery stores. I suspect that there would be no minoxidil-
edema if salt intake were reduced to 0.2 grams/day of sodium. Reduction even to 1.0
gram/day might eliminate most of the diuretic requirement in the vasodilator-beta-blocker
drug combination.

Dr. Frieden’s recent Viewpoint Title in JAMA (32) “Sodium Reduction-Saving Lives by
Putting Choice Into consumers’ Hands” is incisive except for two issues: #1. He fails to
demand of the USDA to use a scientific basis for labelling of foods with the real MDR for
sodium of <0.2 grams/day. And #2, a recommendation for ready availability at low cost of
urine sodium and creatinine measurements for people who really care about preventing a
stroke and other HBP complications. Now few are aware of their sodium intake relative to
the 0.2 gram/day value in Figure 5. Measurements of urine sodium-creatinine are analogous
to monitoring of blood pressure with a cuff for hypertensives or blood sugar for diabetics.
High Pulmonary Vascular Resistance and Minoxidil—Pulmonary vascular
resistance and pressure increases in proportion to peripheral vascular resistance (33,34) and
hypertension. Thus, the isolated reports of high pulmonary vascular resistance associated
with minoxidil are due to the pre-minoxidil status. In fact, minoxidil blunts pulmonary
hypertension from hypoxia (35).
MINOXIDIL & SAVING THE KIDNEYS IN REFRACTORY HYPERTENSION
To the reader it may seem ironic that a stroke and its sequelae were a cause of my writing
of this update on minoxidil. JP’s average blood pressure for three years in the outpatient
clinic of Parkland Hospital had been 239/139 and it had destroyed 90% of his kidney
function. He fit the policy at that time (5) of removing both kidneys to save his life.
However, in the admitting office he had a stroke with coma and no longer a candidate for
hemodialysis so was admitted for stabilization and transfer to a nursing home to die. I
happened to be his attending physician and had just received the research drug minoxidil
from Upjohn. After three days of minoxidil his blood pressure was normal and in two weeks
he walked out of the hospital with a cane and two months later returned to work.
One year later we had accumulated similar experiences (minus the stroke) in 11 patients and
published “Minoxidil, an Alternative to Nephrectomy For Refractory Hypertension” (5)
because of which this horrendous procedure was soon abandoned. Instead of cardiac
problems JP.’s huge cardiac hypertrophy had been reduced to normal voltage on his ECG
and he had had no arhythmias. His kidney function had improved by >50 % from his
remaining 10% and it appeared that this huge problem of severe hypertension-
neprhrosclerosis was solved.
But not quite! One to two years later several of the patients kidney function was
deteriorating. Fortunately, Mitch and Walser (36) had published a straight line of decay of
kidney function (Figure 6) in patients like JP which predicted the date for beginning
hemodialysis in individual patients to within a few months; what a tragic, depressing
perspective! JPs decay of renal function shown in Figure 7 prior to minoxidil fit perfectly
with Mitch and Walser’s observations. Unfortunately, another straight line of decay (Figure
7), albeit at a slower rate, predicted that he would require hemodialysis in 6–7 years which
actually occurred. Because his blood pressures were in the 145/95 range, we suspected that
further lowering of blood pressure might reduce the downward slope of his decay curve.
Nevertheless, the capacity of good blood pressure control to change the slope of the Mitch-
Walser Curve was very encouraging.

In fact, another patient had three slopes of decay of renal function. The first was rapid decay
of renal function, the second with the triple combination of minoxidil, propranolol and
diuretic and the third with an increase dose of minoxidil to 60 mg/day plus clonidine (Figure
8). The latter combination controlled blood pressure in the range of 120/70 mmHg and renal
function was sustained for 14 years at which time I lost contact with CW.
The stage was set to pursue every aspect of interactions of antihypertensive drugs with each
blood pressure support mechanism, one of which is shown in Figure 9. The informative
Dose Response Curve (DRC) for clonidine suppression of plasma NE (37), blood pressure
and plasma renin activity (Figure 10) emphasizes the role of the DRC as the
Pharmacologist’s Sword. Wouldn’t the world be better if each physician could draw the
DRC for every drug she/he prescribes? Or, if definitive DRCs were required before sale of
all dietary supplements?
Maximum lowering of blood pressure and of the high plasma NE concentrations occurred at
or below 0.4 mg/day of clonidine. Higher doses of clonidine produced no additional
lowering of plasma NE nor blood pressure; in fact, blood pressure tended to increase. Also,
higher doses are associated with increased withdrawal symptoms and very HBP with
discontinuation of this drug. Consequently, I recommend 0.2 mg of clonidine at night
(enhances sleep) and 0.1 mg in the AM; I add another 0.1 mg at noon but only if it is really
necessary.
Not only did clonidine lower blood pressure further but appeared to cause diuresis (38). This
effect is expected due to suppression of high reflex-induced NE release directly onto renal
alpha1-adrenoceptors which, in turn, cause renal retention of sodium and water (19–20).
Theoretically, there are two sites of clonidine suppression of NE release; one is in the
cardiovascular control center in the brain which suppresses peripheral sympathetic nerve
activity and the other is on the sympathetic nerve terminal through activation of alpha2As
suppressive to NE release (10). The resulting diuresis is sufficient to increase SRA (38) even
though alpha2As are inhibitory to renin release.
Now if all of this seems a bit complicated just place yourself in CW’s position or that of his
lovely wife Julia, a Cardiologist. She grasped the significance of the decay curves shown in
Figure 8 for CW and Figure 7 for JP so was motivated to take any measures to save his
kidneys. Most importantly, keep in mind the potential for improvement (reduced need for
drugs) if diastolic blood pressure is maintained below 80 mmHg for two to six months (38)
which improvement appears due to reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy (see below).
The First NIH-Supported Randomized Trial Attempting to Save Kidneys
The design of the study (38) is shown in Figure 11. Eighty-seven non-diabetic, severely
hypertensive patients with advanced nephrosclerosis qualified for the study (39). To qualify
they had severe refractory hypertension requiring minoxidil to control (hence the focus on
minoxidil), have lost more than half of their kidney function and to be sufficiently
responsible and compliant to sustain diastolic blood pressure control at <80 mm Hg for 2–6
months prior to randomization. 10% of the original group had failed to sustain diastolic
pressures below 80 mmHg so were not randomized but continued to be followed in the

study. In one randomized group (1/2) diastolic pressures were permitted to rise above 90
mmHg by reducing medication dosage. In the group randomized to lower blood pressures,
we attempted to maintain diastolic pressures below 80 mmHg. Diastolic pressure was
selected because of less variability than in systolic blood pressure.
Our NIH-supported, randomized, long term clinical trial achieved the following:
#1 As a result of 2–6 months of blood pressure control at <80 mmHg in both
patient groups, kidney function improved for three years. Antihypertensive drug
requirement was remarkably reduced in both groups (38). My opinion is that this
quality of blood pressure control for this time interval caused reversal of
arteriolar hypertrophy. This result contrasted with Mitch & Walser’s conclusion
that, “renal disease progression once established progresses irrevocably”
(36) in such patients.
#2 Simultaneous studies (40) reversed the concept that hyper-filtration is the
mechanism for progressive loss of kidney function studied in rats (41,42).
Minoxidil induced hyperfiltration in hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients while
simultaneously improving kidney function over a three year period. Thus, hyper-
filtration cannot be a major mechanism of destroying kidney function in our
patients as suggested by studies in rats (41,42). Minoxidil-induced hyper-
filtration may, in fact, explain why hemodialysis may be discontinued in some
minoxidil treated patients (44) and should be systematically studied for delay of,
or reducing hemodialysis.
#3 Discovery of, and understanding of the mechanism of the PRAS Syndrome
originally described for minoxidil (6) but subsequently found to be related to
severe reversible loss of renal function with other antihypertensive drugs
(43,44). (See below)
#4 Final results of the hypertension nephrosclerosis trial were reported by Toto
et.al. (39). Mean diastolic blood pressure in the Strict Group was 81+/− 1 and in
the conventional group 87 +/− 1 mmHg. The mean slopes of decay of renal
function in both groups were not significantly different from -0-. However, by
combining results in all patients there was a slight but significant decline of
renal function. While it is not possible to identify a specific goal diastolic
pressure I recommend 2–6 months of blood pressure control at or < 80 mmHg
by whatever drug combination is required. For long term maintenance try to
keep resting diastolic pressure < 83 mmHg and the lower the better without
hypotensive symptoms. Reduction of dietary salt intake to <1.0 grams/day will
help greatly.
THE Pseudo-Renal Artery Stenosis Syndrome (PRASS) and Arteriolar
Hypertrophy—PRASS was first described in minoxidil treated patients (6) because it was
the only antihypertensive drug sufficiently effective to control HBP in refractory patients (5).
Reduction of systemic arterial pressure by minoxidil (plus companion drugs) along with
extreme narrowing of arteriolar lumen due to hypertrophy reduced filtration pressure in the
glomerulus to such an extent that little filtration occurred. Also, this reduced pressure

triggered huge rates of renin release but the perfusion pressure was so low that even
angiotensin constriction of the efferent arteriole was unable to maintain filtration, as in
unilateral renal artery stenosis as previously discussed. Thus, the syndrome consists of
reversible very high concentrations of serum creatinine and urea (nearly to uremic levels),
high SRA and edema with weight gain.
Two of these abnormalities, increased renin release and increased tubular reabsorption of
sodium and water, occur in unilateral renal artery stenosis but functioning of the opposite
kidney compensates for the increased reabsorption so split function studies are required to
demonstrate this altered function. However, in bilateral renal artery stenosis, excess
tubular reabsorption is so severe that patients present with extreme HBP and acute heart
failure with pulmonary edema. The PRASS syndrome is therefore like bilateral renal artery
stenosis and, in fact, stenosis is bilateral because it involves all of the pre-capillary arterioles
in both kidneys.
Some of these functional abnormalities also occur with ACE Inhibitors because of the
following paradigm. Renin is released from the juxta-glomerular apparatus located on the
afferent arteriole into the glomerular capillaries heavily laden with converting enzyme which
forms Ang II. Ang II constricts the efferent arteriole which increases feedback pressure to
the glomerulus and maintains filtration in spite of decreased filtration pressure from artery
stenosis. In normal circumstances renin-angiotensin concentration is low, so ACEI do not
decrease glomerular filtration rate normally. However, decreases of glomerular filtration
pressure increase renin release to such an extent that glomerular filtration depends, at least in
part, on Ang II constriction of the efferent arteriole. This phenomenon explains the worst
outcome, apparent renal failure, in the Strict control group of SPRINT Trial in the elderly
(2). Diuretics and ACEI potentiate the PRASS dysfunctions (43).
There are several other important aspects of arteriolar hypertrophy. A major function of pre-
capillary arterioles is to prevent excess flow of blood into capillaries during temporary
increases in blood pressure. Excess flow into capillaries increases transmural pressure in thin
capillary walls forcing water and salt into extracellular spaces and edema. An anatomic
feature of arterioles (Figure 3) includes a fixed dimension fibrous outer layer, a circular
muscle and a thin inner lining which extends into and, in fact, comprises the capillary wall.
This thin lining is the site of exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, sugar, creatine-creatinine
and urea in all tissues. Capillaries in the glomerulus of the kidney constitute the filtering
mechanism, the first step in urine formation. Malignant hypertension occurs when the onset
of extreme elevation of blood pressure occurs rapidly, before sufficient smooth muscle
hypertrophy develops to prevent the excess blood flow into capillaries.
Arteriolar hypertrophy was first demonstrated in the hindlimb arterioles of dogs (circa 1948)
made hypertensive by renal artery constriction. The hypertrophy was prevented by partial
constriction of one femoral artery thereby reducing perfusion pressure of that hindlimb. This
paradigm may explain why blood pressure in my patients on short term (2–3 weeks)
restricted salt intake (0.207 grams sodium) failed to decrease to the levels existing in people
whose salt intake had been limited throughout their life span (30,31). It would be anticipated

that reversal of the hypertrophic smooth muscle encroachment on the lumen of arterioles
caused by chronic hypertension would require significant time to reverse.
One might argue that emphasis on arteriolar hypertrophy and its potential reversal is
inappropriate in an update of minoxidil. However, this concept is useful in explaining
improvement of renal function after only 2–6 months of antihypertensive therapy noted
above (38).
MINOXIDIL-HAIR GROWTH-ROGAINE
Increased hair growth is highly variable with minoxidil administration. Two women age 20
and 24 were so offended by body hair growth that they said that they would rather die, so
stopped taking minoxidil; within six months both were dead. Twin brothers (CB & HB) age
59, had black hair growth over their bodies which was reminiscent of the appearance of
bears; both had hair growth in their ear canals which required trimming. Two women noted
lengthening and thickening of eye lashes requiring trimming to prevent scratching on their
eye-glasses. CB and one elderly obese woman had roughening of facial features but
preferred having blood pressure controlled with minoxidil, the only drug effective enough to
do so. In most patients increased hair growth was not a problem and was, in fact, a beneficial
side effect, especially in men.
Topically applied minoxidil has to be absorbed through the skin, circulate to the hair
follicles and only then does it produce hair growth. It is much easier to take a 5 mg tablet of
minoxidil but the oral form is included in the Black Box Designation by the FDA; how
unfortunate since the off-patent pill is so inexpensive.
The dose-response curve (DRC) for minoxidil-induced hair growth is unknown. However,
from my own experience and observations I suspect that the maximum induction of hair
growth occurs with 5–10 mg/day. Interestingly, the dose-response curve for increased renal
blood flow is biphasic with higher doses (30–40 mg/day) actually decreasing renal blood
flow (46). Possibly the lowered systemic blood pressure plus renal vasoconstrictor effects of
angiotensin plus NE could reduce renal blood flow at higher doses is one possibility.
Whether a similar peak skin blood flow at 5–10 mg/day occurs is unknown.
CONCLUSIONS
#1 Reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy by controlling diastolic pressure <80mmHg
for 2–6 months in our minoxidil trial appears to be a fundamental determinant of
conserving kidney function in high risk patients with nephrosclerosis. Whether
minoxidil may play a unique role in remodeling of arterioles should be
thoroughly investigated (47).
#2 Arteriolar hypertrophy is closely linked to the PRAS Syndrome, the cause of
reversible major loss of kidney function due to blood pressure reduction by
minoxidil and by anti-renin-angiotensin agents.
#3 Edema from minoxidil is caused by at least four mechanisms, each of which is
dependent on dietary sodium in excess of the real MDR for sodium. Thus, the

USDA must resort to fact-based science as reviewed herein, instead of profit-
driven industries for MDR for sodium labeling on food items in our grocery
stores.
#4 Since excess dietary sodium is the basic cause of the vast majority of HBP and
minoxidil edema is dependent on it, hypertensive patients should be “let-out-of-
the-dark” concerning dietary intake of sodium. As with blood sugar for diabetics
and blood pressure cuffs for hypertensives they should have ready access to
inexpensive measurements of urinary excretion of sodium and of creatinine for
monitoring of dietary sodium.
#5 Minoxidil is underutilized (48) due to the FDA’s Black Box Designation which
should be eliminated and appropriate recommendations for its optimal use
inserted into the package insert.
#6 Excellent control of moderate hypertension can be achieved or augmented using
doses of 5–10 mg/day of minoxidil with a betaAB, and with long term use, the
need for the beta-blocker may not even be required. Because of erratic HBP
control with triple therapy and permanent diplopia from a small stroke 20 years
ago, I have personally used minoxidil 5 mg/day plus 25 mg of atenolol each
morning. If I exercise or do manual work in the afternoon I take another 25 mg
of atenolol. On the occasion that I dine at a restaurant I use furosemide 20 mg.
the subsequent morning. My personal experience is a motive for writing this
essay. My resting blood pressures run 115/65 to 130/75.
#7 Minoxidil is valuable in hypertensive patients on hemodialysis because of
cardiovascular stability and, in fact, urine output and renal function can improve
sufficiently with minoxidil to discontinue hemodialysis in some patients.
#8 Use patents for minoxidil are on file (not mine) for prevention of age-related
hearing loss (ie restoration of tiny hair cells on the cochlea which are lost with
age-related hearing loss) and for restoration or maintenance of penile erection in
patients with long standing hypertension. Interestingly, patients in our long term
minoxidil project noted restoration of penile erection; whether it was due to
improved general health or a specific benefit of minoxidil is unknown. Those
were pre-Viagra days so we were not specifically monitoring this issue.

2.2. StudySelection
Theinitial1997CMERsearchwasperformedinPubMedusingthefollowingsearch
terms: magnesium AND (blood pressure OR hypertension) [each term limited to Title
AND/OR Medical Subject Heading fields]. This initial search yielded 259 studies. A
title/abstract scan plus additions from manual searching resulted in 16 studies of oral
magnesiumtherapyforBPforfull-textexaminationanddataextraction.Thesestudieswere
listedbyascendingmagnesiumdoseandpublishedin2003bySeeligandRosanoff[19]
(non-peerreviewed). CMERcontinuouslyupdatedthispreliminary1997PubMedsearch,
creatingdataextractionsheetswithdatatablesforeacharticleandaddingappropriate
articlescitedinpublishedmeta-analyses[11,12]. Datasheetsforeachnewlyaddedarticle
werecreatedandupdatedwithcorrespondencewithauthorswhenappropriate. By2010,
thecollectionhad40relevantarticlesthathadundergonefull-textexaminationanddata
extraction. Thiscollectionofstudieswaspublished,againlistedbyascendingmagnesium
dose,afterbeingfirstcategorizedastonormotensive(NT)orhypertensive(HT)statusas
wellasmedicationusage[20](Figure1).
In2017,the71articlesinfouradditionalpublishedmeta-analysesoforalmagnesium
therapyforBP[9,10,13,14]wereaddedtotheCMERcollectionof40articlesalongwiththe
45articlescollectedforCMER’s2016“PetitionforaQualifiedHealthClaimforMagnesium
forHypertension”[18]. Thisgatheringresultedinatotalof156articles. Duplicateswere
removed,yielding58articlesappropriateforananalysisoforalmagnesiumtherapyforBP.
CMERthenupdateditsoriginalPubMedsearchonFebruary7,2018,yielding168further
studies, three of which were appropriate for addition to the collection. All 61 full-text
articlesplusexistingdatasheetsweregatheredforfinalanalysis.
Twelvearticleswereexcluded[21–32],yielding49articles(seeFigure1). Exclusion
criteria were as follows: pregnant subjects [22], use of oral magnesium supplements
in combination with any other mineral nutrient [21,23,24], no statistical analysis [25],
baseline and/or final SBP or DBP not reported [26,30], a control group using ascorbic
acid or imipramine rather than placebo [27,28], only pre- and post-exercise BP values
were measured over 2 days [29], and Hypertensive subjects were not separated from
Normotensivesubjectsinthestatisticalanalysis[31,32].
2.3. DataExtractionandQualityAssessment
Eacharticleinthefinalcollectionof49articleswasexaminedforstartingSBP/DBP
for both magnesium test and placebo control groups to determine BP status at base-
line. SubjectswithaveragebaselineBP≥140/90mmHgormeanbloodpressure(MBP)
≥106mmHgweredeemedhypertensive;allothersweredeemednormotensive. Studies
werefurtheredexaminedforantihypertensivemedicationusage. Antihypertensivemed-
icationsknowntobeusedinthesestudiesincludeddiuretics(thiazide,spironolactone),
calciumchannelblockers,beta-blockers,angiotensin-convertingenzymeinhibitors,and
alpha-blockers.

3.2. OtherCardiovascularRiskFactors
EvenwhenoralmagnesiumtherapydidnotlowerBPinUntreatedHypertensives,
Controlled Hypertensives or Normotensive subjects, their studies often showed im-
proved parameters linked to cardiovascular health, such as serum or plasma magne-
sium [40,43,44,46–48,74,77,79–81,83,84], improved endothelial function [48], reversal of
retinal vasospasm [52], improved sodium excretion [43,71], lower sodium in red blood
cells [65], higher serum potassium [63], lower C-reactive protein (CRP) [79], improved
fastingglucoseandinsulinresistance[74,78,81,83,88],andlowertriglyceridesandtotal
cholesterolaswellashigherhigh-densitylipoprotein(HDL)cholesterol[74].
3.3. FormofMagnesium
Severalformsofmagnesium,bothorganicandinorganic,wereusedinthesestudies,
and it is interesting to note that the only effective doses of >600 mg/day in Untreated
Hypertensives were in studies using MgO, often noted in advertising as being poorly
absorbed. Magnesiumgivenasaspartate,chloride,oxide,pidolate,lactate,citrate,amino-
acid chelate at doses below 600 mg/day were not effective in this category. It was Mg
dose,notformofMg,thatmadethedifference. Likewise,theseveralformsofmagnesium
showingBP-loweringeffectsinUncontrolledHypertensives(Table2)includedsixformsof
magnesium,bothorganicandinorganic,includingMgO,andallwereeffectiveinlowering
BPbythecriteriaofthisanalysis.
3.4. Magnesium-RepleteSubjects
Two studies on Untreated Hypertensive subjects given 607 and 972 mg Mg/day
showed“nochange”inBP[54,58].Walkeretal.[54]notedthatthesesubjectswere“replete”

Hypertensives(Tables1and2),showedoralMgtherapytohaveaBP-loweringeffect.
Tending to confirm this difference between response to oral magnesium therapy
between NT and HT subjects, Haga [55] administered 600 mg Mg/day to 17 HT and
8NTsubjects. OnlytheHTsubjectsshowedasignificantdecreaseinBP.TheNTsubjects
showednochangeevenatthishighleveloforalmagnesiumtherapy(seeTable1,footnote

3.7. SafetyofMagnesiumDosesinEffectiveRange
Effective magnesium doses in this analysis ranged from 240 to 972 mg/day. For
UntreatedHypertensives,theminimumeffectivedosewas≥600mg/day. Thetolerable
upperintakelevel(UL)ofmagnesiumfornon-foodsourcesis350mg/dayforadults[15,89].
However,thisULwasbasedonlimiteddataand“althoughafewstudieshavenotedmild
diarrhea and other mild gastrointestinal complaints in a small percentage of patients
at levels of 360 to 380 mg per day, it is noteworthy that many other individuals have
not encountered such effects even when receiving substantially more than this UL of
supplementarymagnesium”[18]. Veryhighintakesofmagnesiumsupplementscanbe

3.8. HowDoesThisAnalysisBuildUponExistingMeta-analyses?
AsnotedintheIntroduction,sixmeta-analysesonthistopichavebeenpublishedso
far[9–14]withmixedresultsandmostlyhighheterogeneity. Allincludedrandomized
trials. This qualitative categorization builds on their quantitative work by suggesting
possibleoriginsofthatheterogeneity.
Onemeta-analysisshowsnoeffectoforalmagnesiumand“high”heterogeneityusing
20trialsfromallfourcategoriesofthiscollection[12]. AsecondshowsloweringofDBP
but not SBP, again with high heterogeneity (I2 = 62%/47%), using 12 of the trials from
threecategoriesofthiscollection[11]. Anothermeta-analysis[10]using11trialsofonly
unhealthysubjectsdrewfromthreecategoriesofthisanalysistoshowlowheterogeneity
(I2 =2.1%)intheloweringofbothSBPandDBP.Onlyonepublishedmeta-analysis[9]
showedzeroheterogeneity(I2=0%)withaclinicallyrelevantloweringofbothSBPand
DBP(−18.7/−10.9mmHg)butusingonlyfourtrials,allfromGroup2. (However,this
study’sconclusionsarelimitedbyitsuseofsometrialswithoutaplacebocontrolgroup,
asmostunbiaseddatacomefromsubtractingtheplaceboresponsefromthemagnesium
BPresponsesothemagnesiumeffectwillnotbeoverestimatedinpersonswithelevated

most reliable meta-analyses show that oral magnesium therapy lowers both SBP and
DBP[13,14]using33and34trialsfromallfourcategoriesofthisanalysis,butagainwith
highheterogeneity(I2=80%+and62%+).
Combined with our qualitative findings, these results suggest that use of studies
on both HT and NT subjects as well as the different effective Mg dose in Untreated
Hypertensivesvs. UncontrolledHypertensivesubjectsaresourcesofheterogeneityinMg
forBPmeta-analyses.
4. Discussion
ThiscategorizationclearlyshowsthatNTstudysubjects,bothControlledHyperten-
sivesandNormotensive(i.e.,thosewithanuntreatedhealthyBP),willnotshowlowerBP
withoralmagnesiumtherapy,evenathighdoses. However,severalstudiesinthesenor-
motensivecategoriesreportedsignificantimprovementinbloodmagnesium,lipoproteins,
C-reactiveprotein,fastingglucoseandinsulinresistance,reversalofretinalvasospasm
andincreasedsodiumexcretion,allofcardiovascularriskfactorbenefit. Oralmagnesium
therapyinNTpatients,treatedwithantihypertensivemedicationsornot,maynotshow
improvedBPreadings,buttheseindividualsmaybenefitfromimprovedcardiovascular
riskfactors.

1.Introduction
Insulinresistance(IR)canbedefinedastheinabilityofinsulintostimulateglucosedisposal,
andwhenIRoccurs,insulinsensitivity(IS)willdecrease,thesensitivityoftissuesandtarget
organstoinsulinwilldecrease,andnormaldosesofinsulinwillnotproducethenormalhypo-
glycemiceffect[1].IRisconsideredasthecommoncorepathologicalbasisofmetabolicdisor-
dersincludinghypertension,diabetesmellitus(DM),andmetabolicsyndrome(MS),which
seriouslythreatenhumanhealth[2,3].Thus,improvingISrepresentsoneofthemajorpath-
waysfordrugdevelopment.
ThecloserelationshipbetweenIRandtherenin-angiotensinsystem(RAS)isnotarecent
observation.TheoveractivationoftheRAScanleadtoIRbyaffectinginsulinsignalingpath-
ways,inhibitingfatformation,promotingoxidativestressandinflammation,reducingtissue
bloodflow,andactivatingthesympatheticnervoussystem[4–6].Furthermore,theeffectof
RASblockersincludingangiotensin-convertingenzyme(ACE)inhibitorsandangiotensinII
(AngII)receptorblockers(ARBs)onimprovingIShasgraduallyreceivedattention.Experi-
mentalandclinicalstudieshaveshownthatACEinhibitorsandARBscaninhibittheactiva-
tionofAngII,improvebloodperfusion,reduceoxidativestressandbeta-cellapoptosis,and
thusimproveIS[3,7].However,althoughACEinhibitorsandARBsbothbelongtotheclass
ofRASblockers,differencesbetweenthesetwokindsofdrugsexist.Ameta-analysiscom-
paredstudiesthatusedACEinhibitorsorARBsandfoundthattheformerwasmoreeffec-
tiveinimprovingISinhypertensivepatientswithoutdiabetes[8].However,thisanalysis
waslimitedbecauseonly4randomizedcontrolledtrials(RCTs)with203hypertensive
patientswithoutDMwereincluded.Therefore,moreresearchisneededtobetterunder-
standwhichclassofdrugs(ACEinhibitorsorARBs)hasastrongereffectonISinhyperten-
sivepatients.
Todate,someRCTshavecomparedACEinhibitorswithARBsontheefficacyofimproving
ISinhypertensivepatients,however,thefindingshavebeeninconsistent.Onthisbasis,we
aimtoconductameta-analysisoftheavailableevidencetoinformclinicalpractice.

Abstract: Hypertension represents a major common cardiovascular risk factor. Optimal control of high blood pressure levels is
recommendedtoreducetheglobalburdenofhypertensive-mediatedorgandamageandcardiovascular(CV)events.Amongthefirst-
linedrugsrecommendedininternationalguidelines,renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystemantagonists[angiotensinconvertingenzyme
inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] have long represented a rational, effective, and safe anti-hypertensive
pharmacological strategy. In fact, current US and European guidelines recommend ACEi and ARBs as a suitable first choice for
hypertensiontreatmenttogetherwithcalciumchannelblockers(CCBs)andthiazidediuretics.Differentstudieshavedemonstratedthat
ARBs and ACEi exert a comparable effect in lowering blood pressure levels. However, ARBs are characterized by better pharma-
cological tolerability. Most importantly, the clinical evidence supports a relevant protective role of ARBs toward the CVand renal
damagedevelopment,aswellastheoccurrenceofmajoradverseCVevents,inhypertensivepatients.Moreover,aneutralmetabolic
effecthasbeenreporteduponARBsadministration,incontrasttootherantihypertensiveagents,suchasbeta-blockersanddiuretics.
These properties highlight the use of ARBs as an excellent pharmacological strategy to manage hypertension and its dangerous
consequences.Thepresentreviewarticlesummarizestheavailableevidenceregardingthebeneficialeffectsandcurrentrecommenda-
tions of ARBs in hypertension. The specific properties performed by these agents in various clinical subsets are discussed, also

Introduction
Hypertensionrepresentsoneofthemostcommonandrelevantcardiovascular(CV)riskfactor(RF),accountingformore
than 10 million deaths and 208 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years.1
Indeed, subjects affected by hypertension have a significantly increased risk of major CV events (MACE). The
relationship between blood pressure (BP) levels and vascular mortality shows a
remarkable continuous association, starting from a systolic BP (SBP) level of 115 mmHg and a diastolic BP (DBP)
level of 75 mmHg for each decade of age.2,3
On the other hand, the benefits of antihypertensive treatment are well established. A 10 mmHg decrease in SBP
reduces the risk of MACE by 20%, of coronary heart disease by 17%, of stroke by 27%, of heart failure (HF) by 28%,
and ofall-causemortality by13%.Theseeffectsareindependentofage,baselineBPlevels,concomitantcomorbidities,
and previous CV disease (CVD).4
Moreover,anincreasingbodyofevidenceshowsthatatightercontrolofBPcanimproveCVprevention.Therefore,
the most recent European5 and US Guidelines6 recommend achieving a SBP target between 120 and 130 mmHg and a
DBPtargetbetween70and80mmHginthemosthypertensivepatientsaged<65years.Thisgoalshouldbepursuedby

using combined pharmacological strategies of two or more medications with complementary activity, preferably con-
tained in a single pill.
Duetothefundamentalroleoftherenin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem(RAAS)inthedevelopmentandpersistence
of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are
recommended as a suitable first choice for initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment, either as mono-
therapy or in combination.5–7
In this narrative review, we will discuss and summarize the available evidence on the benefits of the treatment with
ARBs in the reduction of BP levels and in the development of hypertension mediated organ damage (HMOD) and
MACE. We will also discuss their ancillary effects and pharmacological tolerability.
Efficacy of ARBs in Reducing BP Levels
Since the clinical development of ACEi in the Nineties, a large body of literature has shown that the blockade of the
RAAS has a very favorable impact on morbidity and mortality in hypertension management.
ACEi and ARBs share common effects, though with significant differences in their mechanisms of action.8,9
ACEiinhibittheformationofangiotensinIIandconsequentlythedownstreameffectsthroughboththeangiotensinII
type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R). AT1R mediates detrimental effects, such as
vasoconstriction,cellgrowth,sodiumandwaterretentionandsympatheticactivation,whereasAT2Rexertsvasodilation
and antiproliferative effects.10,11 Moreover, the presence of non-ACE pathways, such as chymases, caspases and
elastases, leads to a continued low-level production of angiotensin II in the CV system despite the inhibition of
ACE.12 Finally, ACEi inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin, which releases nitric oxide and increases the synthesis of
vasoactive prostaglandins, causing vasodilation.13
Incontrast,ARBsspecificallydisplaceangiotensinIIfromtheAT1RandincreasethestimulationofAT2R.Theclass
of ARBs includes several compounds that share similar effects, though presenting specific pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic characteristics and ancillary effects, such as the increased urinary uric acid excretion and the
activationof peroxisomeproliferator-activatedreceptor (PPAR)-γ.14The lattereffecthasbeendescribed fortelmisartan,

A large body of evidence has shown that ARBs have a comparable efficacy in reducing BP levels with respect to
ACEi. However, some studies demonstrated a greater antihypertensive effect of ARBs. The treatment with azilsartan
produced a 20.6 mmHg reduction of office SBP compared to 12.2 mmHg achieved with ramipril.17 Consistently, a
greaterreductionincentralSBPwasobtainedwitholmesartancomparedtoperindopril(13mmHgvs10mmHg)when

Study.18Ameta-analysisof354randomizedtrialsshowedthatalthougha10-mmHgdecreaseinofficeSBPwasobtained
with both ARBs and ACEi, these results were achieved with an ARB standard dose, whereas almost twice the standard
ACEi dose was needed to achieve the same SBP decrease.19

moderateessentialhypertension)olmesartanproducedagreaterreductionofofficeSBPandDBPandof24-houraverage
BP,particularlyinthe last6hoursfrom thedosing intervalcomparedtoramiprilina populationof olderhypertensives.
BP normalization rate was also greater in patients treated with olmesartan.20
ARBs can be effectively combined with either diuretics, in particular thiazide-like diuretics, or dihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), in an attempt to enhance their ability to lower BP. These combinations show an
excellent tolerability profile and a high adherence to the prescribed antihypertensive regimen. Compared to ARB-based
monotherapies,thecombinationtreatmentbasedonARBsandthiazidesproducedagreaterreductioninbothofficeSBP
and DBP and in mean sitting BP values. Consistently, also mean daytime and mean 24-hr SBP and DBP were
significantly lowered with the ARB/thiazide combination treatment compared to monotherapy.21–24 These results have
also been confirmed in the elderly patients aged 65 years or older.
In addition, theARB/CCB combination has the advantageof combiningthe optimalpharmacodynamic propertiesof
the two pharmacological classes, thus providing a relevant antihypertensive efficacy and a satisfactory safety profile.
Different trials demonstrated that the combination of ARB and CCB was significantly more effective than each single
componentofeithermonotherapyinreducingbothseatedSBPandDBPlevelsand24-hrBP.Furthermore,combination
therapieswerewelltoleratedandassociatedwithalowerincidenceofoedemacomparedtothemonotherapywithafull
dose of CCB.25–27
In those patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension or in those with treated uncontrolled hypertension under dual
therapy, triple combination therapies should be adopted to achieve the recommended BP treatment targets. In fact, they
are associated with greater reductions in both SBP and DBP levels as compared with dual-combination therapies.28
In such a context, combination therapies with long-lasting ARBs may be preferred to favor adherence to treatment
and to improve BP control.
The Role of ARBs in Preventing HMOD and MACE
Overthelasttwentyyears,severalrandomizedclinicaltrialshaveshownthebeneficialroleofARBsinthepreventionof
HMOD and MACE, beyond their BP-lowering effect, revealing non-inferiority to ACEi and often superiority to other
drug comparators (Table 2).
The LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction) trial was the first study to demonstrate the superiority of
the ARB losartan in reducing the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy compared to the beta-blocker atenolol in over
9000 patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension. The incidence of the primary composite endpoint of CV mortality,
strokeandmyocardialinfarction(MI)wasalsolowerinpatientswhoreceivedlosartan.Moreover,losartantreatmentwas
associated with a 25% lower incidence of new-onset diabetes.29
In the MOSES (MOrbidity and mortality after Stroke Eprosartan compared with nitrendipine for Secondary preven-
tion) trial conducted in hypertensive patients with a historyof a cerebral event within the previous 24 months, the ARB
eprosartan showed superiority to the CCB nitrendipine for the secondary prevention of morbidity and mortality after
stroke.30
Notably, ARBs reduce the occurrence of new-onset diabetes. Thus, they should be preferred in subjects with
metabolic syndrome or other clinical conditions which may predispose to the incidence of this syndrome (5–7)
(Table 2). Different studies have shown that ARBs are able to improve insulin sensitivity both in experimental models

resistance.
ARBshavealsobeenshowntodecreasetheadiposetissueweightandtheadipocytesizeandtoincreasetheadipose
expression of PPAR-γ and of its target gene adiponectin, independently of their effects on BP and plasma insulin
concentration.31 Moreover, both azilsartan and valsartan enhanced adipogenesis, induced the expression of adipokines,
including leptin, adipsin, and adiponectin, and enhanced the expression of PPAR-α and -δ in cultured preadipocytes.32
In the animal model of obese Koletsky rats, treatment with azilsartan decreased hyperinsulinemia, improved the
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index, suppressed the over-increase in plasma glucose and insulin concen-
trations during the oral glucose tolerance test, and reduced the basal plasma concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, and
non-esterified fatty acids.33
Several studies have demonstrated a protective role of ARBs toward the development of microalbuminuria or overt
proteinuria, which represent relevant RF for chronic kidney disease development and for the progression to end-stage
renal disease, particularly in diabetic patients (Table 2).
Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the normalization of glomerular capillary pressure, the inhibition of
podocyteinjury,aswellasoftheproliferationofmesangialcellsandoftheepithelial–mesenchymaltransitionoftubular
cells have been proposed.34
Olmesartan was associated with a delayed onset of microalbuminuria in the ROADMAP (Randomised Olmesartan
And Diabetes Microalbuminuria Prevention) study.35
Irbesartan was shown to delay the progression from microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria and to restore normo-
albuminuria in a significant proportion of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, irbesartan reduced
the risk of advanced nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of BP control.36
In the RENAAL (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan),37 IDNT
(Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial)38 and IRMA (IRbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and
Microalbuminuria)36 studies, the treatment with ARBs reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease compared to the
conventional optimal therapy.

Indeed, studies performed in patients with hypertension, stable angina or type 2 diabetes mellitus, the long-term
treatment with ARBs showed a reduction in the levels of markers of vascular inflammation [high-sensitive C-reactive
protein (CRP), alpha tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemotactic protein-1], a regression of the
atheromatous plaque volume at the carotid and coronary arteries and a regression of vascular hypertrophy.41
In patients with high CVrisk, ARBs have shown comparable protective effects with respect to ACEi.
The ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) study,
whichincluded25,000patientswithcoronary,peripheralorcerebrovasculardiseaseanddiabeteswithendorgandamage,
demonstrated that telmisartan had similar effects compared to ramipril on the primary composite endpoint of CV death,
MI, stroke or hospitalization for HF and death from any cause.42
In a large meta-analysis, conducted by Bangalore and colleagues on 37 randomized clinical trials including 147,020
participants, ARBs were not associated with an increase in the risk of MI, death, or angina pectoris. Compared with
controls, ARBs were associated with a reduction in the risk of stroke, HF and new onset diabetes with similar results
when compared with placebo or with active treatment.43

and following MI [OPTIMAAL—OPtimal Trial In Myocardial infarction with Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan,48
VALIANT—VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion].49 This evidence achieved with different compounds supports
the beneficial impact on CVoutcomes as a class effect of ARBs.
In addition, several meta-analyses have been performed to compare the effects of ARBs vs ACEi in terms of CV
benefits. In a meta-analysis including 80 trials with 146 active treatment arms and 17 placebo arms, ARBs reduced the
left ventricular mass by 13% and ACEi by 10%, although the difference was not statistically significant.50 Urinary
protein excretionwas similarly reduced by ACEi and ARBs in anothermeta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials
including 17,951 patients.51
In a meta-analysis including 26 randomized trials of 100,000 high CVrisk patients, Savarese et al showed that both
ACEi and ARBs reduced the risk of the composite endpoints of MI, stroke, and CV mortality without significant
difference.52
A Cochrane meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with a prespecified follow-up period of at least one year including
about 11,000 participants demonstrated no significant differences in total mortality, CVevents and CV death between
patients treated with ACEi or ARBs. In addition, ARBs were slightly more tolerable than ACEi with an absolute risk
reduction for withdrawals due to adverse events.53
In the propensity score–adjusted REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) cohort of 40,625
patients the incidence of the primary compositeoutcome of CV mortality, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitaliza-
tion for CVreasons was lower in patients taking ARBs compared to those receiving ACEi (29.2% vs 33.4%; adjusted
hazardHR,0.90;95%CI,0.86–0.95;p<0.001)duringthe4-yearfollow-upperiod.54Similarresultswereobservedfor
CV mortality (6.9% vs 8.2%; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (11.6% vs 12.6%; HR:
0.89, 95% CI, 0.82–0.97; p = 0.005).54
Moreover, a meta-analysis of 106 randomized trials including 254,301 patients without HF showed that ARBs were
asefficaciousandsafeasACEi.55Similarly,inanetworkmeta-analysisofrandomizedtrialsofpatientsathighCVrisk,
ARBs and ACEI prevented the composite endpoint of CV death, MI, and stroke in a comparable manner.56
The recently published LEGEND-HTN (Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of
Databases for Hypertension) study compared the real-world effectiveness and safety of ACEi (n = 2,297,881) and
ARBs (n = 673,938) for the first-line treatment of hypertension across a global network of 8 large observational
databases.57 Of these patients, over 123,000 patients on ACEi and 44,000 on ARBs had >500 days of follow-up. The
4 primary effectiveness outcomes consisted of acute MI, hospitalization for HF, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and a
composite outcome which included the previous outcomes and sudden cardiac death. The study also analyzed safety
outcomes or adverse effects including angioedema, cough, hypotension, syncope, and electrolyte abnormalities. No
statisticallysignificantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenpatientsonACEiandonARBsregardingacuteMI(hazardratio

0.91–1.27) and the composite outcome of CV events (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.25). Across secondary and safety
outcomes, ACEi showed a significantly increased risk of acute pancreatitis (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04–1.70, P = 0.02),
angioedema (HR, 3.31; 95% CI, 2.55–4.51, P < 0.01), cough (HR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.11–1.59, P < 0.01), gastrointestinal
bleed (HR, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.01–1.41, P = 0.04), and abnormal weight loss (HR, 1.18, 95% CI, 1.01–1.41, P = 0.04) as
compared with ARBs. There was no statistically significant difference across any of the safety outcomes, including
deterioration of renal function and electrolyte abnormalities.57
Other analyses have reported that ACEi have several-fold higher incidence of side effects at most
dosescomparedtoARBs(Table2).Inaddition,thepooledestimateofwithdrawalratesresultingfromadverseevents
(WDAEs) for all doses was significantly lower with ARBs compared to ACEi.53
Thomopoulos et al found that, compared with placebo, ACEi and not ARBs significantly increased discontinuation
rates for adverse events (RR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.37 to 5.47).58
In other head-to-head comparisons, withdrawal rates with ARBs were 22% lower than with ACEi.
With regard to angioedema, which is a rare but sometimes life-threatening condition, the risk of developing it was
two-fold lower in patients receiving ARBs when compared with those treated with ACEi.59

ARBs and COVID-19
In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, a concern was raised that RAAS inhibitors might increase the risk of
infection, severe disease, or death due to their capacity to upregulate the expression of ACE2, which represents the
bindingsiteofSARS-CoV-2asthegatewayforentryintocells.62Furtherstudies,however,proposedthattreatmentwith
ACEi or ARBs might even reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Indeed, the ACE2 counteracts the ACE
pathway by cleaving angiotensin-II to angiotensin-(1-7), thereby reducing angiotensin-II availability to the AT1R.63 Of
interest, angiotensin-(1-7), through its MAS-receptor, plays vasodilatation, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-
proliferative actions which may contribute to reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease and to improve prognosis64–68
(Table 2).
In the randomized BRACE-CORONA trial,659 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were assigned tocontinuation
of ACEi/ARB treatment or temporary suspension of the therapy for 30 days. There were no significant differences
betweenthetwogroupsintheprimaryoutcomeofthenumberofdaysaliveandoutofhospitalat30days.69Inacohort
of hospitalized COVID-19 patients the ARB telmisartan significantly reduced CRP levels and COVID-19 related
outcomes, including intensive care unit admission, time to discharge and death, compared to usual care.70 The results
ofthesestudiesprovidefurtherscientificevidencethatearlierconcernsabouttheuseofRAAS-inhibitorsinpatientswith
COVID-19 were unwarranted and may even result in benefits.71
Of note, previous studies have shown that ACEi reduce the risk of pneumonia, including aspiration pneumonia in
elderly patients with stroke.72–74
Conclusions
The available evidence supports the effectiveness of ARBs in reducing the incidence of HMOD and MACE in
hypertensive patients, with a better safety profile compared to ACEi. Current US and European guidelines equally
recommendACEiandARBsasfirst-linetherapiesbothasmonotherapiesandincombinationwithotherpharmacological
classes (Table 2). Due to the more tolerable profile of ARBs, with a lower risk of withdrawals due to adverse events,
theseagents maybepreferredtoincrease thepercentageoftreated hypertensivepatients whoachievetherecommended
BP targets. Moreover, a large body of evidence supports the safety profile and even the protective role of the RAS
blockers during COVID-19. As a result, international guidelines and expert consensus have repeatedly recommended to
not discontinue the treatment with ACEi/ARBs in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
