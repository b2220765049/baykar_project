In addition, we summarize\nwhat is known about current predictors of white coat hypertension, reevaluate the relationship of white coat hypertension\nto cardiovascular outcomes, and provide some clinical guidance on management.\nRecent Findings Differences in outcomes exist when white coat effect occurs in unmedicated people versus the white coat\neffects in those on antihypertensive therapy."

During follow-up, there were 26.6% patients occur-\nring MACE in the LVDD group at baseline, 9.9% patients occurring MACE in the group with normal diastolic function.\nIn multivariable Cox regression analyses, LVDD was a stronger predictor of MACE (HR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.20 to 5.25; c- sta-\ntistics 0.805) than E/e′ ratio (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.22).

As ERPs alone have the potential in the current era to catch very early deficits, they can be\nconsidered a game changer in dealing with cognitive disorders. They are beneficial in screening and\ndiagnosing and can help assess cognition as a reliable tool to show the effect of treatments/interventions on\ncognitive defects.

Carr, PhD, FGSA\nAbstract\nObjectives: High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, a major risk factor for death and disease, is pervasive among older\nadults. While reducing BP to targeted levels can prevent adverse outcomes, rates of successful BP control remain subop-\ntimal, and it is unclear whether older adults recognize its proven benefits. The current study sheds light on older adults’ be-\nliefs about the consequences of hypertension and benefits of BP control by examining how their self-reports of hypertension\ndiagnosis and BP control, as well as measured BP, contribute to subjective life expectancy (SLE), their perceived probability\nof surviving to a target age.\nMethods: In a representative sample of U.S. adults aged 50–89 from the 2006–2014 Health and Retirement Study"

Among diagnosed hypertensives,\nthose who self-report controlled BP expect to live longer than those who do not. Finally, about 1 in 10 older adults have\nhigh measured BP but have never been diagnosed with hypertension, and most diagnosed hypertensives with uncontrolled\nmeasured BP self-report their BP as controlled.\nDiscussion: Older adults appear to recognize the harmful effects of hypertension and the benefits of BP control, but often\nlack knowledge of their own hypertension and BP control statuses. Health communications should continue to stress the\nvalue of BP control, although improvements may require increased hypertension awareness and BP monitoring."

In programs screening\nfor high-risk of CVD, risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, are\ndetected and treated, which by extension, treats and reduces CVD risk [5].\nIn 2016, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Health (MOH) set targets to reduce the prevalence of hypertension\nby 25% and to reduce mortality due to diabetes and CVD by 20% by 2025 [6]. It has set up 1,000\ndedicated clinics–Healthy Lifestyle Centres–capable of screening nearly one million people\na year for risk factors which lead to CVD [7–9]. The screening assesses hypertension status,\ndiabetes status, and CVD risk in people aged 35 and over without pre-existing CVD [9].

It is\nassociated with increased financial burden due to polypharmacy, and the cost of care of co-\nmorbidities or complications. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension is not accurately\nknown globally. This is due to the evolving understanding of RH in the last two decades which\noccasioned the use of different definitions and methodologies. However, in the last decade and\na half, consensus definitions have been more specific.

The specificity of present\ndefinitions was made possible by the increased understanding [10] of factors that cause falsely\nelevated office BP leading to pseudo-RH. These factors include inaccurate BP measurement,\ninadequate antihypertensive medication combinations, medication non-adherence, white\ncoat hypertension, and treatment inertia [10]. The converse occurs when office BP is falsely\ncontrolled in the absence of out-of-office BP measurement that will show poor BP control.\nThis is seen in patients with masked hypertension (MH), and this causes underestimation of\nRH.

Standardized office and home BP readings were obtained, and we applied the AHA/ACC 2017 guidelines to iden-\ntify sustained, white coat, and masked hypertension phenotypes. We measured personal stress with the perceived stress scale and\nneighborhood deprivation with the CDC Social Vulnerability Index.\nRESULTS: Of the 38.3% (138/360) with any hypertension, 26.1% (36/138) reported a diagnosis of hypertension but were currently\nuntreated.

Pathologically, changes in local ACE, AT1R, and eNOS\nexpression were involved in these processes induced by a high-salt diet. Our study suggests that salt\nrestriction and ACE inhibitor treatment improve high salt intake-induced MSA dysfunction in SSH, and\nsalt restriction is a feasible and effective treatment.

In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7933 hospitalized with\nCOVID- 19, we tested their association with in- hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a con-\ntemporary cohort (May– August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 0.53– 1.13, P=0.18)\nnor ARBs (HR, 0.88; 0.61– 1.26, P=0.48) were associated with hospitalization risk.

Nearly 30% of these reclassified hypertensive participants (versus 20% among the\npre-2017 hypertensive participants) had no other CVD risk factors (i.e. diabetes,\nhypercholesterolemia, active smoking, obesity or reduced renal function) other than age.\nMoreover, in the ASPREE cohort, the 10-year predicted CVD risk as well as observed CVD"

This suggests the reclassification of hypertension among the healthy elderly\nusing the combination of lower BP thresholds and CVD risk calculator is less sensitive in\nidentifying individuals with significantly higher CVD risk than those identified using\ntraditional BP thresholds (i.e. ≥140/90 mmHg).\nOur findings on hypertension prevalence are consistent with other studies, which have\nexamined the potential impact of the AHA/ACC 2017 guideline on prevalence of\nhypertension in the United States and Australian general populations [15,16].

Recent studies suggest\nthat the prevalence of MH in adult patients is between 10 and 25% [1-5], and may be even\ngreater in patients with borderline elevated office BP.

Cost should not be a\nbarrier to improving primary aldosteronism screening adherence.\nBackground\nPrimary aldosteronism (PA) is a frequent etiology of secondary hypertension. Although\npreviously thought to be a rare diagnosis with a relatively benign impact, it is now\nrecognized to represent 5% to 10% of all hypertension cases and 12% to 22% of resistant\nhypertension.1-5 Further, PA bears a risk profile that is substantially higher than that of\nessential hypertension.2,6-8 A proportion of these patients—those with unilateral etiologies\nof hyperaldosteronism such as aldosteronoma or unilateral hyperplasia—may achieve cure\nwith surgery, and those who are eligible for medical management benefit meaningfully from\nearly targeted treatment.9"

An embarrassing fact to our\nhypertension community is that over 40% of hypertensives’ blood pressure is sustained\nabove 140/90 mmHg in the USA (3). Even though Minoxidil is virtually free of toxicity the\nFDA has essentially shut down its use by a Black Box Designation. This designation\nresulted from two side effects (cardiac symptoms and edema) that could have been, and\nshould have been controlled by companion drugs which, in fact, potentiate minoxidil’s\nefficacy.\nChidsey’s prophetic analysis (4) in 1973 of minoxidil’s role was ignored by the FDA and by\nthe medical community.

It soon became apparent that far better blood pressure control was\nneeded to “save-the-kidneys” and that more understanding of drug interactions with\nminoxidil and blood pressure support mechanisms might enable us to achieve better blood\npressure control. These interactions extend to fascinating intra-renal mechanisms involving\narteriolar hypertrophy, adrenergic receptors, renin-angiotensin and the increasingly\nrecognized cause of reversible renal failure from drugs, the Pseudo Renal Artery Stenosis\nSyndrome (PRASS) (6).

In one randomized group we attempted to maintain diastolic\npressures below 80 mmHg and in the other to permit diastolic pressure to be maintained\nabove 90 mmHg by reducing drug dosages.

Diuretics and ACEI potentiate the PRASS dysfunctions (43).\nThere are several other important aspects of arteriolar hypertrophy. A major function of pre-\ncapillary arterioles is to prevent excess flow of blood into capillaries during temporary\nincreases in blood pressure. Excess flow into capillaries increases transmural pressure in thin\ncapillary walls forcing water and salt into extracellular spaces and edema. An anatomic\nfeature of arterioles (Figure 3) includes a fixed dimension fibrous outer layer, a circular\nmuscle and a thin inner lining which extends into and, in fact, comprises the capillary wall.\nThis thin lining is the site of exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, sugar, creatine-creatinine"
